Now, a raft of companies say they could finally make it a reality.\n\nAt an American football stadium in Florida last March, an unusual test took place. Here, it wasn\'t footballs being thrown, but beams of light across the length of the pitch. The concentrated streaks of light lasted for a few minutes, fired from an emitter on one side of the field in the Jacksonville Jaguars\' stadium and collected on a screen on the other.\n\nThe light was collected from the Sun and them beamed out by large lenses on the field like a magnifying glass, each about 1.2m (4ft) tall. \"We had to get up a ladder to pull the cover off,\" says Andrew Rush, president and chief executive of the Florida-based company Star Catcher that carried out the test.\n\nThe goal? To see if beaming sunlight across space to power satellites was feasible.\n\n\"We knew some folks at the Jaguars and we thought this would be a cool thing to do,\" says Rush. \"We beamed 100 watts about 105m [345ft].\"\n\nStar Catcher is one of several companies around the world developing space-based solar power technologies, a concept that has languished in a grey area between science fact and science fiction for decades. The idea is to provide Earth with abundant clean energy by capturing sunlight in space and beaming it to the ground or other satellites.\n\nSolar panels on terra firma are, by contrast, limited by the atmosphere, the weather and Earth\'s day-night cycle. These all affect how much sunlight those panels can soak up, filtering out varying amounts of the Sun\'s radiation before it can reach ground level. But in space, it is possible to collect sunlight almost around the clock at much higher efficiencies.\n\n\"I remember telling my father about this and he thought I was a bit bonkers,\" says David Homfray, co-founder and chief technology officer of UK firm Space Solar. But multiple countries, including the UK, US, Japan and China are now investing in the technology.\n\n\"Space-based solar power makes the energy transition work,\" argues Homfray, noting that some estimates claim it could supply up to 80% of Europe\'s renewable energy needs.\n\nThis is largely due to the higher power density – more than 10 times higher – that space-based solar has compared to those based on the Earth\'s surface – it can convert far more of the Sun\'s energy into electricity.\n\nIt would likely require enormous satellite constellations, which might be controversial, difficult to operate safely and require a significant number of rocket launches to construct. Plus, there are cheaper and easier forms of renewable energy that could come online far quicker – which is important given the need to replace fossil fuels with greener alternatives if the world is to have any hope of bringing global warming under control.\n\nEven so, there are some who believe the rewards for building solar power stations in space will come to far outweigh the drawbacks. The US military, for example, is very keen on a technology that will allow it to beam energy to anywhere in the world on demand, helping to overcome one of the major problems faced on modern battlefields, but it could be equally as useful in the aftermath of disasters or for rural communities.\n\nSpace-based solar power works much like solar on Earth – panels convert sunlight into electricity – but with one huge advantage: they\'re above the atmosphere. This means those panels can collect sunlight that hasn\'t been filtered through the gas and clouds that cloak our planet. The atmosphere reflects around 30% of the energy that reaches our planet while it absorbs around a quarter before it even reaches the Earth\'s surface. Space-based solar panels can avoid this effect, but can remain in near-constant sunlight if placed in the right orbit.\n\nOnce collected, this power can be transmitted to Earth as microwaves or laser beams, and captured by large ground antennas that convert it back into usable electricity. To make economic sense, however, each satellite must generate and beam immense amounts of power at gigawatt scale, requiring massive arrays assembled in orbit.\n\nUS science-fiction author Isaac Asimov first wrote about tapping solar energy from space in 1941, in a short story called Reason. Later, in the 1970s, studies by Nasa concluded that, while it was intriguing, there were major technological and economic barriers.\n\nJohn Mankins, a former Nasa physicist and proponent of space-based solar power, led another study in the 1990s that suggested the idea was becoming more practicable due to advances in solar cells and other technologies. \"It was a change in feasibility from $1tn to $100bn, [£750bn to £75bn],\" he says. \"But it was not an era when anyone was interested in that.\"\n\nSpace-based solar was \"extraordinarily polarising 30 years ago\", says Mankins. \"People either loved it and they were passionately in favour of it, or they absolutely hated it.\"\n\nOver the past decade, however, things have changed, says Mike Curtis-Rouse at UK-based research organisation Satellite Applications Catapult. \"We\'ve seen an upswell in the amount of interest,\" he says.\n\nThis has, in part, been driven by the falling cost of launching objects into space and the arrival of huge new rockets such as SpaceX\'s Starship, which is undergoing testing in Texas. Advancements in satellite manufacturing, robotics and power-beaming technology have also brought the prospect of space-based solar into view.\n\n\"We\'re kind of reaching that critical mass point,\" says Curtis-Rouse. \"I\'m reasonably confident we\'ll see space-based solar capability in orbit within the next two decades.\"\n\nIn 2023, the UK government awarded £4.3m ($5.7m) in funding to multiple companies working on space-based solar power.\n\nIn China, scientists are working on a prototype space solar-power satellite called Omega 2.0, which uses microwaves to transmit the power from an array of solar panels. They propose assembling a 1km-wide (0.6 miles) antenna in orbit along with 600 solar sub-arrays that each measure 100m (330ft) wide. Tests on the ground have so far managed to transmit up to 2,081 watts – enough to power a kitchen kettle – over a distance of 55m (180ft) using the microwave transmission technology.\n\nThe European Space Agency\'s Solaris initiative is also due to make a decision later this year on whether space-based solar is worth investigating further. In the US, several companies are developing space-based solar-power technologies with funding from the US military.\n\n\"It\'s a lot closer to reality than a lot of people think,\" says Michelle Hanlon, a space lawyer at the University of Mississippi. \"Once you make that initial investment, that power is literally free. So it\'s about having the wherewithal and vision to make that investment.\"\n\nOne company working on the technology is Aetherflux, a start-up based in California.\n\n\"Space-based solar power is this fantastical idea,\" says founder Baiju Bhatt. \"The question behind the company was, if you want to do this today – not in 2050, but in the next two to three years – what is the approach you would take?\"\n\nAetherflux intends to deploy a fleet of satellites equipped with high-powered infrared lasers and photovoltaic cells into low Earth orbit. These satellites would collect solar power before it is then beamed down to Earth to collection points on the ground measuring perhaps just 10-20m (30-60ft) across, giving them a relatively small footprint. As a safety precaution, each laser would be designed to turn off instantly should anything fly into its path, such as an aircraft or another satellite, in case it damaged their sensors or occupants.\n\nThe lasers are too weak to cause significant damage – they aren\'t going to break a plane in two, for example – but are powerful enough that their health effects do need to be considered, says Curtis-Rouse.\n\n\"The aspiration is not to build a Death Star,\" says Curtis-Rouse. \"The reality is the energy would take a while to fry an egg. That way things can pass through it – birds, planes, Superman, whatever the case may be.\"\n\nThe technology could be useful for energy-starved locations, says Bhatt, with the military a potential key early adopter. \"The US government has huge energy needs all around the world,\" he says.\n\nIn April, Aetherflux announced that it had raised $50m (£37m) in funding. The firm plans to launch a demonstration satellite in 2026 that will practise beaming a 1km-wide (0.62 miles) laser to solar panels on the ground. \"The best-case scenario is we\'ll see a couple of hundred watts of power,\" says Bhatt.\n\nThe company has yet to release any details about how its infrared laser transmission system performs in tests on Earth.\n\nSpace Solar in the UK is taking a different approach – it envisages giant solar power stations in space the size of cities that could beam down enough energy to power entire countries. It\'s a monumental task, but one that Homfray believes is possible.\n\n\"By 2050, there\'s no reason not to expect space-based solar power doesn\'t provide 20% of all global power,\" he says.\n\nSpace Solar, which received about £1.2m ($1.6m) in UK government funding, plans to launch two demonstration missions during the next three years, one to practise transmitting power to the ground via radio waves, and another to show how robots could build large structures in space.\n\nEventually, the company says, it wants to construct a giant 1.8km-wide (1.1 miles) structure in space which it plans to call Cassiopeia. Positioned about 36,000km (22,000 miles) above Earth in geostationary orbit, meaning it always remains above the same spot on the planet and in near-constant daylight, the station would use millions of table-sized satellites covered in solar panels to collect incoming sunlight. Roughly a billion antennas would beam the collected power to a receiving station on the ground the size of Heathrow Airport, which would in turn convert the radio waves into electricity.\n\n\"If you had a dozen of those in the UK, that would probably cover the UK\'s entire energy needs,\" says Curtis-Rouse.\n\nOne Cassiopeia could have a capacity of around 700 megawatts says Homfray, enough to power half a million UK homes and about a quarter of the energy output of the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station currently under construction in Somerset.\n\nEarlier in 2025, Space Solar announced it had built a robotic demonstrator for constructing the structures its technology will need in space. Last year the company demonstrated a 360 degree wireless energy transmission in a laboratory at Queen\'s University Belfast, in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe US company Virtus Solis is also working on space-based solar power technology. It would group 200,000 honeycomb-shaped satellites together in vast constellations spanning multiple kilometres. Those constellations would have unusual Molniya orbits that swing widely around the planet, enabling them to spend long periods over high latitudes to beam power to the northern hemisphere. Virtus Solis plans to launch a demonstration mission in 2027.\n\nIf successful, chief executive and founder John Bucknell says, energy costs on Earth could drop dramatically. \"The global average for electricity is about $75 [£55] per megawatt hour,\" he says, whereas space-based solar power could eventually offer electricity at $0.50 [£0.40] per megawatt hour based on the company\'s modelling. \"So for you, me, everyone – our annual energy use is about $10 [£7] in that category,\" says Bucknell. \"That\'s what our goal is.\"\n\nSome, however, do not agree that space solar power can be delivered at low cost. One assessment of large-scale space-based solar power designs suggests electricity produced in this way could cost 12-80 times more than Earth-based alternatives.\n\nSpacecraft could one day beam power to other places besides Earth. Star Catcher – the company behind the test at the NFL stadium in Florida – is looking into whether it might one day redirect sunlight to satellites, giving them a power boost in space.\n\nTheir beam system would use a series of Fresnel lenses – the kind lighthouses have long used to reflect and refract light – to focus sunlight onto the solar panels of satellites. Rush says the technology could give satellites more power than they can obtain from natural sunlight alone.\n\n\"They get power when the Sun is shining on them, and when it\'s not they don\'t have any power generation,\" he says. \"What we\'re doing is transmitting to those satellites. […] We can vary the intensity from one Sun to ten Suns.\"\n\nSuch a system could also help supply energy to rovers on the Moon, which must survive lunar nights lasting up to two weeks, says Rush.\n\nBut not everyone is convinced by space-based solar power. One concern is the challenge of launching and operating so many satellites in space, something never attempted on the extremely large scale proposed by space-based solar firms.\n\nManaging hundreds or thousands of satellites stitched together, and stopping them colliding with other satellites, is a big challenge says Francesca Letizia, a space debris expert at the European Space Agency in The Netherlands. Any accidents could quickly pour cold water on the nascent industry. \"Even a few events would be really detrimental,\" she says.\n\nPlus, such large constellations may not even be legal, says Hanlon. Under the Outer Space Treaty of 1967, no country is allowed to claim ownership of any parts of Earth orbit. \"Does that change when we\'re talking about a square-mile array?\" says Hanlon. \"I would think if China announced it\'s going to have 4 sq miles [10 sq km] of satellites, the US is going to complain.\"\n\nWhether space-based solar power is really achievable is another question. A 2024 Nasa report said that the technology currently remains far more expensive than terrestrial renewables and was possible only with major advances in launch, manufacturing, and efficiency.\n\n\"We\'re certainly in a better spot than we were 30 years ago,\" says Charity Weeden, a former Nasa Associate Administrator for technology, policy and strategy, and a space policy expert. \"But are we at the precipice of, like, let\'s go do this?\"\n\nKaren Jones, a space economist and technology strategist at The Aerospace Corporation, a US non-profit, says international cooperation will likely be needed to make space-based solar work: \"This is carbon-free energy,\" she says. \"Let\'s hope it happens, because right now there\'s a lot of distrust in space.\"\n\nSuch an initiative might mirror the collaboration that supported the construction of the International Space Station (ISS), which is itself the size of a football pitch.\n\n\"You could have a single investment in space-based solar power over the equator,\" says Mankins. \"Depending on the demand, it could beam power to Poland, to London, to Riyadh, to Cape Town – and it could switch multiple times a day.\"\n\nCountries that need power during a crisis, such as after a major hurricane, could also benefit – a temporary lifeline before they get their electricity grids working again. \"You could beam even smaller amounts of power to hospitals, and so on,\" says Jones.\n\nStar Catcher is planning its next major test soon, not on an American Football pitch, but on a runway once used by Nasa\'s Space Shuttle at Cape Canaveral in Florida. It would set a new record for transmitting power wirelessly.\n\n\"We\'re going to beam power multiple kilometres down that runway,\" says Rush.\n\nWhether this fascinating technology will ever manage to take off, though, remains a big question.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can\'t-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\n\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook and Instagram.', 'https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251021-134202-667692b2c6-web-2.32.2-1/grey-placeholder.png', 'https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20251029-the-beam-dream-should-we-build-solar-farms-in-space', 'scraped', '2025-10-30 21:01:35', 1, 0, 1, NULL, '2025-10-30 21:01:35', '2025-10-30 21:01:35'),

El precandidato sostuvo que varias de estas personas fueron \"víctimas de una persecución\" política que se extendió por diez años.\n\nIndicó que, a su juicio, a estas personas, a quienes el Tribunal Constitucional (TC) les dio la razón al dejar sin efecto la investigación por vulneración al principio de legalidad y al derecho a un plazo razonable, les asiste el derecho y la obligación de participar en política para evitar que tales abusos se repitan contra otros ciudadanos.\n\nRespecto a la decisión de Fujimori de no postular al Senado, Torres lo calificó como una demostración de que la lideresa está enfocada únicamente en la Presidencia y que no busca un premio consuelo, frase utilizado por la líder de Fuerza Popular al anunciar su precandidatura.\n\nSobre el plan de seguridad de Fuerza Popular, Torres señaló tres ejes: contar con el respaldo de los militares, recordando la estrategia del \"soldado amigo\" utilizada en los años 90 para el combate conjunto contra el terrorismo; la construcción de nuevos penales en zonas alejadas, donde las señales de teléfono no permitan seguir articulando el \"terrorismo urbano\"; y restablecer el respeto y la autoridad, brindando protección y respaldo legal a los policías y militares.\n\nMuchos peruanos aún ignoran los beneficios del DNI electrónico.

Estados Unidos debe cesar tales ataques y tomar todas las medidas necesarias para prevenir las ejecuciones extrajudiciales de personas a bordo de estas embarcaciones, independientemente de la conducta delictiva que se les impute”, remarcó Türk.\n\nNoticias, entretenimiento en vivo, debates intensos sobre fútbol y más. ¡Entra ya! 👇\n\nLa Administración de Donald Trump ha justificado esas acciones, al señalar una lucha contra el “narcoterrorismo” y asegura estar en un \"conflicto armado\" con los cárteles de la droga. Para ello, se ha apoyado en la misma autoridad legal utilizada por el gobierno de George W. Bush cuando declaró la guerra contra el terrorismo tras los atentados del 11 de septiembre de 2001. Sin embargo, aun si se tratara de narcotraficantes, los expertos cuestionan que EE. UU. esté facultado legalmente para matar a los ocupantes de las lanchas en vez de detenerlos.\n\n“Combatir el grave problema del tráfico ilícito de drogas a través de las fronteras internacionales es, como se ha acordado desde hace tiempo entre los Estados, una cuestión de aplicación de la ley, regida por las estrictas limitaciones al uso de la fuerza letal establecidas en el derecho internacional de los derechos humanos (...) Según el derecho internacional de los derechos humanos, el uso intencional de la fuerza letal solo se permite como último recurso contra personas que representan una amenaza inminente para la vida”, remarcó el Alto Comisionado de la ONU para los Derechos Humanos.\n\nDurante los últimos meses, el debate por parte de legisladores de Estados Unidos ha escalado más allá de los límites de las facultades del presidente, ya que los asaltos han ocurrido sin ninguna investigación legal ni la tradicional declaración de guerra del Congreso. Algunos legisladores han cuestionado la falta de pruebas contundentes que justifiquen los asesinatos.\n\n“Con base en la escasa información proporcionada públicamente por las autoridades estadounidenses, ninguna de las personas a bordo de las embarcaciones atacadas parecía representar una amenaza inminente para la vida de otros ni justificar de otro modo el uso de la fuerza letal contra ellas según el derecho internacional”, agregó Türk.\n\nAnte este panorama, el alto funcionario de la ONU pide investigaciones “rápidas, independientes y transparentes” sobre estos ataques.\n\nFuncionarios estadounidenses confirman el despliegue de tres destructores con misiles guiados Aegis en aguas frente a Venezuela como parte de las medidas de Trump para combatir las amenazas de los cárteles de la droga latinoamericanos. La fuerza naval en el Caribe creció en cuestión de semanas hasta incluir tres buques de asalto anfibio y otras dos embarcaciones de la Armada estadounidense, con un total de unos 6 000 marineros e infantes de marina. Los buques de asalto anfibio cuentan con diversas aeronaves a bordo, y Estados Unidos desplegó aviones de combate F-35 en Puerto Rico en septiembre.\n\nUn submarino de la Armada también opera en aguas suramericanas y es capaz de transportar y lanzar misiles de crucero.\n\nEstados Unidos realiza su primer ataque contra lo que Trump afirma era un buque narcotraficante que partió de Venezuela y era operado por el Tren de Aragua. Trump afirma que 11 personas murieron y publica un breve video de una pequeña embarcación que parece explotar en llamas. El video no muestra ningún alijo grande o visible de drogas dentro de la embarcación.\n\nEn Venezuela, el ministro del Interior, Diosdado Cabello, acusa al gobierno estadounidense de asesinato, al tiempo que cuestiona cómo las personas a bordo de la embarcación atacada estaban vinculadas a la banda.\n\n\"¿Y cómo los identificaron como miembros del Tren de Aragua? ¿Tenían, no sé, un chip? ¿Tenían un código QR y (el ejército estadounidense) lo leyó desde arriba, a oscuras?\", preguntó Cabello. \"Confesaron abiertamente haber asesinado a 11 personas\".\n\nEl ejército estadounidense lleva a cabo su segundo ataque contra un presunto narcotraficante, matando a tres personas.\n\nAl preguntársele qué pruebas tiene Estados Unidos de que el buque transportaba drogas, Trump declaró a la prensa: \"Tenemos pruebas. Basta con mirar el cargamento esparcido por todo el océano: grandes bolsas de cocaína y fentanilo por todas partes\".\n\nTrump afirma que el ejército estadounidense lleva a cabo su tercer ataque mortal contra un presunto narcotraficante. El presidente afirma que el ataque mató a tres personas y que la inteligencia \"confirmó que el buque traficaba narcóticos ilícitos\".\n\nVarios senadores y grupos de derechos humanos siguen cuestionando la legalidad de los ataques, describiéndolos como una posible extralimitación de la autoridad ejecutiva.\n\nTrump declara a los cárteles de la droga como combatientes ilegales y afirma que Estados Unidos se encuentra ahora en un \"conflicto armado\" con ellos, según un memorando de su Administración obtenido por la agencia de noticias AP.

La repatriación evitó preguntas sobre cuál habría sido su estatus legal en el sistema judicial estadounidense.\n\nEl ejército estadounidense ataca una séptima embarcación que, según Hegseth, transportaba \"cantidades sustanciales de narcóticos\" y estaba asociada con un grupo rebelde colombiano, el Ejército de Liberación Nacional (ELN).

De esta mezcla nació Bohemian Rhapsody, cons', 'Hace 50 años, el cantante británico Freddie Mercury se propuso cambiar las reglas de la música y fusionar géneros como el rock o la ópera en un único tema. De esta mezcla nació Bohemian Rhapsody, considerada una de las mejores canciones de la historia y convertida en un himno intergeneracional.\n\nEl 31 de octubre de 1975, Bohemian Rhapsody vio la luz como el primer sencillo del cuarto álbum de Queen A Night at the Opera, una apuesta arriesgada, especialmente para las radios de la época, por sus casi seis minutos de duración, pero que dio sus frutos: el tema se mantuvo 9 semanas en el número uno en las listas de éxitos británicas y catapultó al estrellato mundial a la banda londinense.\n\nCompuesta principalmente por Mercury, la canción fue apodada primero como La cosa de Fred (Fred´s thing), pues según cuenta el guitarrista de Queen, Brian May, en el documental de la BBC La historia de Bohemian Rhapsody (2004), al contrario que otros temas del grupo que nacieron en el estudio, esta fue una excepción porque todo estaba construido de antemano en la cabeza de Freddie.\n\nEn el libro Freddie Mercury: su vida contada por él mismo (2006), que reúne sus citas y entrevistas, el \'frontman\' de Queen confiesa que Bohemian Rhapsody era algo que llevaba mucho tiempo queriendo hacer y que, en realidad, eran tres canciones distintas que acabó juntando.\n\n\"Solo quería meter algo de ópera en un contexto de rock and roll. ¿Por qué no? Se trataba de ir tan lejos como me permitieran los límites de mi capacidad\", dijo Mercury.\n\nUno de los aspectos más destacados de Bohemian Rhapsody es precisamente su compleja estructura musical. La canción comienza con una introducción a capela, seguida por una balada, una sección operística, una parte de \'hard rock\' y finalmente un cierre melódico.\n\nLa producción, a cargo de Roy Thomas Baker, también supuso un gran desafío técnico que superó a la tecnología de aquel momento. Las gargantas de Mercury y dos de sus compañeros de banda, Brian May y Roger Taylor, crearon un efecto coral de cerca de 200 voces y regrabaron sobre la cinta hasta el punto de volverla transparente y llegar prácticamente a romperla.\n\nWelcome to this Queen The Greatest Special, in which we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the phenomenal Bohemian Rhapsody! 👑50 Years ago today, on October the 31st, 1975, Queen’s masterpiece was released, and began the journey to becoming one of the greatest songs of all… pic.twitter.com/aEx1Cx3dMn\n\nPero el secreto mejor guardado de Bohemian Rhapsody es su significado. Incluso el propio Mercury afirma en el libro que siempre decía que no sabía de qué iba la canción y prefería que la gente fuese la que la escuchase y decidiese por sí misma qué representa, para así mantener el misticismo que la rodea.\n\n\"¿Es esto la vida real o tan solo una fantasía?\", canta Mercury al inicio, para seguidamente confesar ese sentido \"Mamá, acabo de matar a un hombre\"; y más tarde preguntar al personaje cómico Scaramouche si bailará un fandango o invocar al mismísimo Belcebú.\n\nCinco décadas después, Bohemian Rhapsody sigue viva y se reinvindica como una auténtica obra de arte musical, especialmente recordada por las memorables actuaciones de la canción en vivo a cargo de Mercury, como la del concierto Live Aid en el estadio de Wembley en 1985.\n\nAunque inicialmente tuvo un recibimiento mixto por parte de la crítica, la canción acumula un enorme palmarés de reconocimientos. La BBC la eligió en 2002 como el mejor tema de los 50 últimos años y la revista Rolling Stone, que primero llegó a tildarla de \"mezcolanza descarada\", le otorgó en 2021 un notable decimoséptimo puesto en la lista de las 500 mejores canciones de la historia.\n\nBohemian Rhapsody es de esas canciones que todo el mundo ha escuchado -o cantado-, al menos, una vez en la vida. Pero incluso May, que puede haberla tocado miles de veces en medio siglo, confesó esta semana en una entrevista con la BBC que no se cansa de ella.\n\n\"Después de cincuenta años, nunca me aburro, jamás. Nunca me canso de hacerla. Es increíble. Siempre es un reto (...) Siempre es como esto va a funcionar. Funciona con públicos de todas las edades, de todo tipo. Y todo el mérito es de Freddie. Es la obra maestra de Freddie\", comentó el guitarrista de Queen.\n\nNoticias, entretenimiento en vivo, debates intensos sobre fútbol y más. ¡Entra ya! 👇', '/uploads/news/scraped-c7a86264380c342a4bf8db6bdbea156e.jpg', 'https://rpp.pe/musica/internacional/bohemian-rhapsody-cumple-50-anos-como-freddie-mercury-creo-la-cancion-mas-ambiciosa-de-queen-noticia-1661793', 'scraped', '2025-10-31 14:38:16', 1, 0, 1, NULL, '2025-10-31 14:38:16', '2025-10-31 14:38:16'),

Este auspicioso resultado motiva el ingreso de nuevos competidores que ven a este sector financiero del Perú \"fuerte y sólido\".\n\nJorge Mogrovejo, superintendente adjunto de Banca y Microfinanzas de la SBS indicó que este rubro presenta un nivel de competencia más amplio de lo que suele percibirse. Según explicó, el mercado está conformado por entidades con modelos de negocio diferenciados, que ha permitido que la competencia no se concentre solo en los grandes bancos, sino en segmentos específicos de crédito y servicios financieros.\n\nPUEDES VER: Banco Central de Reserva pide ajustar gasto: \"Es necesario contener el déficit para evitar que la deuda siga aumentando\"\n\n\"Cuando se dice que falta competencia, muchas veces no se observa la foto completa\", sostuvo el ejecutivo durante su presentación en el foro de Banking & Finance Sunmit 2025 organizado por El Dorado Investments, en el que este diario estuvo presente.\n\nPUEDES VER: Salario pretendido de los peruanos aumenta a S/3.314, pero el ingreso real y el sueldo mínimo frenan el optimismo\n\nLa estructura actual del sistema incluye cuatro bancos grandes (BCP, BBVA, Interbank y Scotiabank), que tienen el 82% de la torta de participación de la banca y atienden el negocio universal, pero también existen bancos medianos, entidades especializadas en crédito corporativo, compañías orientadas a crédito de consumo, instituciones dedicadas a crédito vehicular para personas, y otras enfocadas en vehículos pesados como buses y camiones.\n\nEl sector financiero agrupa a un total de 47 entidades entre bancos, microfinancieras, corporativos, de crédito vehicular, hipotecario entre otros.\n\nAdemás, resaltó la presencia de unas 22 cajas y entidades microfinancieras, que compiten directamente en el segmento de microcrédito, tradicionalmente más cercano al pequeño negocio y al autoempleo.\n\nEsta diversidad, agregó, le permite al cliente elegir entre instituciones con estrategias focalizadas y no solamente entre bancos de gran escala. \"La competencia no se mide solo por cuántos bancos hay, sino por cuántas alternativas reales tiene el usuario según su necesidad\", remarcó.\n\nPUEDES VER: Extorsiones ponen en jaque al sistema microfinanciero de Perú: podrían cerrar 250 agencias y dejar sin crédito 500.000 emprendedores\n\nMogrovejo destacó que, en los últimos cinco años, han ingresado nuevas entidades al mercado, particularmente extranjeras que decidieron competir de forma selectiva. Entre ellas mencionó:\n\n\"Estos ingresos muestran que el Perú sigue siendo atractivo para la inversión financiera\", afirmó el funcionario.\n\nEl sistema financiero peruano podría incorporar hasta siete nuevas entidades financieras y tres nuevas billeteras digitales en los próximos meses, lo que reforzaría la competencia en segmentos como banca digital, microcrédito y pagos electrónicos, informó Mogrovejo. Según explicó, la SBS evalúa expedientes de licenciamiento en curso de estas entidades:\n\nA ello se suma que existen proyectos en etapa de interés avanzado, próximos a solicitar autorización formal, para la creación de dos nuevas empresas de crédito y dos nuevas emisoras de dinero electrónico (billeteras digitales).\n\nArturo García, docente de ESAN y presidente del Comité de Empresa, Banca y Finanzas del Colegio de Economistas de Lima explicó a La República que el banco de crédito corporativo está orientado al segmento empresarial con ventas anuales de entre 20 millones y superiores a S/200 millones. En cuanto a un banco digital, señaló que está orientado a clientes empresas como cartera minorista o retail (mypes o personas).\n\nLa financiera especializada en microcrédito estará orientada a segmentos micro y pequeñas empresas (mypes con ventas menores a S/5 millones), las cuales están segmentadas por nivel de endeudamiento del sistema financiero, que según García, es de hasta S/300.000.\n\n\"El 98% de empresas en el perú son mypes. El nivel de endeudamiento de una microempresa es menor a S/30.000\", explicó.\n\nDe acuerdo con el especialista, el arribo de nuevos competidores traerá un beneficio directo que apuntará específicamente a la reducción de las tasas de interés (lo que se cobra por un crédito), más aún considerando que en el segmento mype y consumo, la reducción del interés ha sido lenta y se mantiene alto en los últimos años.\n\n\"Todo es beneficioso porque la mayor competencia de entidades financieras que van a los distintos segmentos de crédito va a generar una reducción gradual de las tasas de interés\", indicó a este diario.\n\nEn los últimos tres años, el BCRP viene disminuyendo la tasa de referencia (4,25% a la fecha), pero esto se ha trasladado en mayor cuantía en el segmento corporativo y gran empresa, comentó García.\n\nUn elemento fundamental en el mayor dinamismo competitivo, dijo, ha sido la interoperabilidad de pagos asestada por el Banco Central de Reserva del Perú (BCRP).\n\nLa integración entre bancos y billeteras digitales ha reducido barreras de entrada, permitió que usuarios de distintas plataformas interactúen entre sí y abrió espacio para que fintechs y emisoras digitales puedan competir sin necesidad de operar redes propias extensas.\n\n\"La exitosa interoperabilidad interoperabilidad por el Banco Central de Reserva ha generado un interés en que entren más y crean diferentes mercados\", apuntó.\n\nFinalmente, Mogrovejo destacó la puesta en marcha del proyecto de finanzas abiertas, que permitirá que los clientes autoricen el traslado de su información financiera entre entidades para obtener mejores condiciones y productos. El modelo se sustenta en los principios de reciprocidad, seguridad, transparencia y consentimiento expreso del usuario. \"facilita dinamisa la actividad financiera, la sbs ha creado unidad open banking, mayor oferta de producto en general\".\n\n\"El objetivo es promover la innovación, fomentar la competencia y empoderar al usuario en el uso de sus datos\", explicó el funcionario.\n\n\"Hoy la mayoría de transacciones se realizan a través de billeteras digitales, y ya no es necesario tener oficinas para abrir cuentas o hacer pagos. La regulación peruana ya permite operar banca digital completa”, señaló. No obstante, advirtió que \"el reto grande es el tema de la seguridad. Una entidad puede entrar en dificultades no por prestar mal, sino porque sus sistemas fallan\", manifestó Mogrovejo.\n\nEl sector bancario reportó ganancias netas por S/10.674 millones, de enero a setiembre, lo que representó un crecimiento interanual del 43%, según datos de la SBS. De acuerdo con el análisis de Cesar Antunez, economista especializado en finanzas, este resultado se vio acompañado de un aumento del 5,4% en el saldo de créditos directos y de una reducción de 0,8 puntos porcentuales en la tasa de morosidad.\n\nSi bien las colocaciones (préstamos) al sector mayorista sufrieron una contracción del 11,7%, esta fue compensada por el crecimiento de los préstamos minoristas (25,6%) y de la banca personal (9,1%). Además, los créditos dirigidos a la pequeña empresa (+131,7%), microempresa (+32%), grandes empresas (+28%) y consumo (+12%) registraron un sólido crecimiento interanual.\n\n\"Entre los factores que explican estas ganancias se destacan el crecimiento de los ingresos financieros y de los ingresos por servicios financieros, el aumento de las comisiones por desgravamen (13%), que sumaron S/1.236 millones al sistema financiero de enero a setiembre, la disminución del costo de captación, reflejada en una reducción del gasto financiero al 12% y la caída del gasto en provisiones (-32%), explicó.\n\nEn cuanto a la calidad de la cartera, la tasa de morosidad se ubicó en 3.4%, una disminuciónde de 0,8 puntos porcentuales. Los segmentos con mayor morosidad fueron la mediana empresa (12%), seguida por la pequeña empresa (10%) y la microempresa (5%).\n\nLos bancos también pueden clasificarse según su foco de negocio principal. Los que reportaron un mayor crecimiento de ganancias fueron la banca retail o de consumo (136%), la banca mixta (35%) y la banca corporativa o empresarial (14%).\n\n', '/uploads/news/scraped-2c763c5e0b14ce47a0d48ae7be839b5d.webp', 'https://larepublica.pe/economia/2025/10/30/sbs-siete-nuevas-entidades-financieras-y-tres-billeteras-digitales-calientan-su-ingreso-a-peru-a-quienes-apuntan-y-en-que-beneficia-hnews-1702500', 'scraped', '2025-10-31 16:05:51', 1, 0, 3, NULL, '2025-10-31 16:05:51', '2025-10-31 16:05:51'),

Una vez admitido este recurso legal, el juez tendrá un máximo de 30 días para resolver si se declara fundada o no.\n\nEn la misma línea, exigió celeridad al Poder Judicial para decidir el destino de la demanda de amparo. Inicialmente, estaba programada una audiencia para el 2 de octubre, pero esta se pospuso hasta el 18 de diciembre. Luego de que sesione esta instancia, se espera que en 10 días se emita una sentencia, aunque el plazo podría prolongarse debido a la carga procesal que tiene el PJ.\n\n\"Tanto en Minem como en Senace hemos obtenido silencios administrativos o rechazos. Pero, en la sede judicial, no no tenemos ninguna decisión negativa, sino una demora que nos preocupa.

El primer gran estallido ocurrió en el 2011 durante los últimos meses del gobierno de Alan García. En aquella época, el EIA fue declarado inadmisible y la empresa tuvo que retirarlo.\n\nDos años después, se presentó un nuevo estudio que fue aprobado en agosto del 2014, lo que provocó sendas protestas. Finalmente, durante la gestión de Martín Vizcarra, se dio luz verde a la licencia de construcción y posteriores protestas obligaron al Consejo de Minería a suspender este permiso.\n\n\"Venimos desde un valle agrícola que da de comer al país.

Por este motivo, la Policía Nacional del Perú presume que Genrry Anchelia habría estado a punto de recuperarlo cuando fue atacado a balazos por dos sujetos desconocidos.\n\nPUEDES VER: Tráiler se incendia en plena avenida Universitaria en San Martín de Porres y provoca fuerte congestión vehicular\n\nLos testigos de la zona señalaron que fueron dos sujetos quienes estaban a bordo del vehículo junto a la víctima cuando le dispararon. Tras recibir un impacto certero, Genrry perdió el control del coche y terminó estrellándose con un montículo de tierra que estaba en la avenida. Los sicarios huyeron con rumbo desconocido.\n\n\"Había dos, uno salió por el copiloto, por eso está la puerta abierta en el auto\", sostuvo un vecino que presenció el crimen. \"El carro vino a toda velocidad. Por eso es que hemos corrido y le desconectamos la batería\", contó otro testigo para Latina.\n\nAl respecto, los efectivos de la Policía Nacional continúan con las investigaciones del caso, ya que presumen que la víctima habría intentado recuperar su vehículo robado cuando sucedió el ataque. Sin embargo, las circunstancias precisas del asesinato aún no han sido esclarecidas.\n\nPUEDES VER: Estudiante de ingeniería sufre brutal agresión camino a una reunión y acaba en emergencia en SMP\n\n¡Sigue a La República en WhatsApp!

En minería e hidrocarburos se han destrabado proyectos de alto impacto como San Rafael, Retamas y Lote 95, con inversiones conjuntas superiores a US$200 millones. En energía y electricidad, se aprobaron estudios e iniciaron operaciones en proyectos estratégicos como La Niña–Piura, Piura Nueva–Colán, Belaunde Terry–Tarapoto y Puerto Maldonado–Iberia, que fortalecerán la capacidad eléctrica del norte, oriente y sur del país.\n\nEn comercio, transporte, construcción y agroindustria, las medidas desregulatorias han reducido tiempos de tramitación, unificado licencias y acelerado procesos de digitalización, generando mayor predictibilidad para invertir y operar.\n\n“Tan grave como la corrupción es mantener requisitos innecesarios que abren espacio al aprovechamiento indebido. Simplificar no es improvisar: es ordenar con transparencia y responsabilidad para que cada inversión se traduzca en empleo y bienestar”, subrayó la ministra de Economía y Finanzas.\n\nPUEDES VER: MEF prepara decreto de urgencia por S/1.200 millones para seguridad ciudadana\n\nEn contraste, Julio César Bazán Figueroa, presidente de la Central Unitaria de Trabajadores del Perú (CUT Perú), cuestionó que la política anunciada por el MEF sea, en realidad, la continuidad del denominado shock de inversiones implementado durante el gobierno de Dina Boluarte.\n\n“Esta política es la continuidad de otras que en su momento llamaron un shock de inversiones, donde incorporaban cuatrocientas cincuenta y tantas medidas para dar confianza a los inversionistas, generar empleo, etcétera, cuando lo real era permitir el abuso y la arbitrariedad de las empresas”, señaló Bazán.\n\nEl dirigente sindical advirtió que ese tipo de medidas incluyeron intentos por derogar el decreto 001 sobre tercerización fraudulenta, modificar el decreto 014 que protege la libertad sindical y la negociación colectiva, y debilitar normas laborales que garantizan derechos fundamentales.\n\n“Todo el paquete estaba orientado a favorecer la conducta empresarial irresponsable, cuando lo que el Estado debe promover es la conducta empresarial responsable, respetuosa de los derechos laborales”, remarcó.\n\nEn la misma línea, el Secretario General Adjunto de la CGTP, Gustavo Minaya, sostuvo que el actual \"shock desburocratizador\" es una reedición del llamado “shock desregulatorio”, impulsado en anteriores gestiones, que “a todas luces busca seguir afectando los derechos de los trabajadores”.\n\nRecordó que durante la gestión del exministro de Trabajo Daniel Maurate se planteó dejar sin efecto los Decretos Supremos 001 y 014 del 2022, normas que el propio ministerio promulgó para frenar el uso indebido de la tercerización y fortalecer la libertad sindical.\n\n“El sector empresarial denunció esas medidas porque limitaban la contratación de empresas tercerizadoras incluso dentro del núcleo del negocio”, señaló.\n\nPUEDES VER: Petroperú: ministra de Economía confirma cambio de directorio de empresa estatal esta semana\n\nMinaya añadió que el Decreto Supremo 014, que protege el derecho a la libertad sindical, ha sido motivo de debate internacional: “El Perú ha sido calificado por la OIT, en 2023 y 2025, como país infractor del Convenio 87, porque aquí la libertad sindical está muy restringida”, afirmó.\n\nA su juicio, eliminar o debilitar estas normas implica retroceder aún más en materia de derechos laborales.\n\n“Esta situación ahora se agrava con el nuevo nombre que le están dando de desburocratización, porque entendemos que en el aspecto de productividad y competitividad van a ir sobre los trabajadores del sector público, poniendo en riesgo su estabilidad”, añadió Bazán.\n\nEl dirigente de la CGTP coincidió en que este tipo de reformas terminan beneficiando principalmente a las grandes empresas, sin atender a las micro y pequeñas, que enfrentan falta de acceso a crédito, tecnología y ahora también a seguridad, al estar expuestas a extorsiones y amenazas del crimen organizado.\n\n“En lugar de atender esos problemas, el Ejecutivo prioriza medidas que solo favorecen a la mediana y gran empresa”, subrayó.\n\nBazán afirmó que la CUT rechaza este tipo de políticas porque “ocultan su verdadera intención en el terreno laboral”, y recordó que durante el gobierno anterior también se pretendió “eliminar o consolidar varios programas específicos”, afectando a trabajadores del Estado.\n\nPUEDES VER: MEF destina S/48 millones al Ministerio Público para reforzar fiscalías y la lucha contra el crimen organizado\n\nPara el dirigente, la principal preocupación es que “estas medidas sirvan para justificar el abuso empresarial en la empresa privada, los despidos, la reducción de personal, la tercerización fraudulenta y el bloqueo a las negociaciones colectivas”.\n\n“En el sector público, además, existe el riesgo de despidos arbitrarios bajo criterios subjetivos. Lo que exigimos es una garantía de que el Estado cumplirá y hará cumplir los derechos fundamentales de los trabajadores, tanto en la empresa privada como en la administración pública”, enfatizó.\n\nBazán también exhortó al Ejecutivo a atender al 70% u 80% de trabajadores que se generan su propio empleo en la economía informal, mediante apoyo a sus unidades productivas.\n\n“De esa manera podría mejorar la economía y las condiciones de vida de la ciudadanía, que debería ser el verdadero objetivo del Estado”, remarcó.\n\nPor su parte, Minaya señaló que la CGTP ha presentado su agenda laboral al actual ministro de Trabajo, exigiendo que se fortalezcan los mecanismos de protección frente a los despidos individuales y colectivos, así como garantías efectivas para los dirigentes sindicales.\n\n“El Ministerio de Trabajo está en la tribuna observando; sus procedimientos son obsoletos y no protegen a los trabajadores ni a quienes deciden formar sindicatos”, denunció.\n\nTambién anunció que el próximo 14 de noviembre la CGTP se movilizará junto a diversos gremios y colectivos “para reclamar la defensa de la vida, el trabajo y los derechos fundamentales del pueblo peruano”.\n\nFinalmente, el líder sindical de la CUT señaló que el perfil del MEF se mantiene pese al cambio de autoridades, y que las medidas recientes “profundizan una política que aleja al país de las recomendaciones de la OCDE sobre derechos laborales fundamentales”.\n\n“Este tema no es solo una demanda de los trabajadores del Perú, sino una recomendación de la OCDE para poder ingresar a ese club de países. Ignorarla retrasa ese proceso”, concluyó.\n\n', '/uploads/news/scraped-8dc04c6d334687c0081a02ec0a55a008.webp', 'https://larepublica.pe/economia/2025/11/03/mef-impulsa-shock-de-desburocratizacion-mientras-sindicatos-alertan-riesgos-laborales-hnews-190320', 'scraped', '2025-11-05 03:10:41', 1, 0, 3, NULL, '2025-11-05 03:10:41', '2025-11-05 03:10:41'),

Desde entonces, los pobladores del Valle de Tambo han recalcado su oposición a este proyecto y han manifestado su predisposición para sostener un diálogo con el gobierno actual. Precisamente, el presidente del Consejo de Ministros (PCM), Ernesto Álvarez, se refirió a ellos.\n\n\"Hay dirigentes que han anunciado que continuarán labores de agitación y propaganda para evitar que se lleve a cabo el proyecto. Detrás de ellos hay ONGs (...) con una agenda internacional: quieren preservar el ambiente para que norteamericanos y europeos puedan gozar de la tranquilidad en el futuro. Pero, son indiferentes a la pobreza y miseria de nuestro pueblo\", dijo el premier a Panorama.\n\nRespecto a la fecha de inicio del cuestionado proyecto minero, Álvarez señaló que no existen plazos definidos, puesto que tendrán que enfrentar \"una oposición bien financiada y con mucha experiencia\". A propósito, hay que recordar que, la etapa de construcción de Tía María se encuentra al 23% y que la fase de operaciones está programada para el 2027.\n\nPUEDES VER: Tía María: Pobladores del Valle de Tambo recurren al Poder Judicial para detener proyecto de Southern\n\nEn conversación con La República, Miguel Meza, vocero del Valle de Tambo, consideró que las declaraciones del titular de la PCM sobre la ausencia de plazos definidos buscan poner \"paños fríos\" para que la población baje la guardia en su lucha contra el proyecto Tía María. No obstante, informó que ellos se encuentran coordinando la realización de una asamblea popular para definir una fecha de movilización.\n\nDe igual forma, recordó que desde hace varios años existe una campaña de criminalización contra los dirigentes sociales. Actualmente, Jaime De La Cruz, alcalde de Dean Valdivia y Jesús Cornejo, expresidente de la Junta de Usuarios del Valle de Tambo, purgan prisión, otros se encuentran en clandestinidad y hay varias carpetas fiscales en contra del propio Meza.\n\n\"Tengo más de 11 investigaciones policiales provenientes del paro que se realizó en febrero.

Sin lugar a dudas, se trata de una imposición sin licencia social\", enfatizó Meza.\n\nPUEDES VER: Arequipa: cuestionan aprobación de proyectos mineros sin consulta popular\n\nPor su parte, el dirigente Jesús Cornejo, calificó como falsas las acusaciones del premier contra las organizaciones que cumplen las labores de defensa legal en la lucha contra el proyecto Tía María y saludó que desde el Ejecutivo se reconozca su defensa del ambiente, aunque descartó que sea para beneficios de otros países del extranjero.\n\nNo dejó pasar la oportunidad de hacer un llamado al Poder Judicial para que resuelva con celeridad la medida cautelar que interpusieron hace algunos días. En opinión de Cornejo, el Estudio de Impacto Ambiental (EIA) de Tía María ya perdió vigencia y no cuenta con los permisos necesarios para realizar las actividades de explotación.\n\n\"Esperamos que el Poder Judicial actúe con independencia y que tomen en cuenta la opinión del Valle de Tambo.

Según Miguel Palomino, presidente de la Asociación Nacional de Conductores Profesionales del Perú (ANCPP), más del 80% de las empresas formales suspendieron completamente sus labores en respuesta a los asesinatos de varios conductores, ocurridos incluso en pleno estado de emergencia decretado por el Gobierno de José Jeri.\n\nPor su parte, Martín Ojeda, director de la Cámara Internacional de la Industria del Transporte (CIT) —que agrupa a distintos gremios de las periferias de Lima—, señaló que la paralización de 24 horas busca exigir acciones concretas frente al incremento de los ataques contra los transportistas, así como el cumplimiento de los acuerdos suscritos con el Ejecutivo en reuniones anteriores. En respuesta a la medida, el Ministerio de Educación (Minedu) y diversas universidades dispusieron clases virtuales, mientras que el Ministerio de Trabajo exhortó a las empresas a implementar el trabajo remoto y otorgar una tolerancia de hasta dos horas para los trabajadores.\n\nMartín Ojeda, director de la Cámara Internacional de Transporte, señaló que las líneas de transporte paralizaron sus labores únicamente por 24 horas, es decir, solo el martes 4 de noviembre. Por su parte, Miguel Palomino, presidente de la Asociación Nacional de Conductores, indicó que existieron desacuerdos entre los representantes de los gremios, lo que impidió alcanzar un acuerdo sólido en la lucha contra el sicariato y las extorsiones. “Respetamos el paro de 24 horas; los compañeros guardarán sus buses y mañana (5 de noviembre) recién saldremos a trabajar”, declaró a La República.\n\nLa Asociación Nacional de Periodistas del Perú (ANP) informó a través de su cuenta en X (antes Twitter) que periodistas de distintos medios fueron empujados por agentes policiales durante la salida del presidente José Jeri de la Plaza de Acho, tras una reunión con transportistas y el alcalde del Rímac. El gremio precisó que varios equipos periodísticos cayeron al suelo y fueron retenidos temporalmente, impidiéndoles continuar con su cobertura.\n\nEl panorama en los distintos puntos de Lima muestra una situación más calmada: no se observa a transportistas protestando en las calles ni vías bloqueadas, como ocurrió durante las primeras horas del día. Sin embargo, los gremios mantienen su medida de presión.\n\n\"Nosotros no estamos levantando el paro. Nosotros continuamos el paro y respetamos el paro de 24 horas. No creo que los compañeros salgan a trabajar ahora. Van a guardar los buses, pero descansan. Mañana salimos a trabajar\", explicó Miguel Palomino a La República.\n\nSamuel Aguilar, gerente de la empresa Nueva América, que también acató el paro, denunció una falta de coordinación entre la PNP y la ATU luego de que 36 buses fueran detenidos en la vía pública, pese a que —según indicó— se habían reunido previamente con el presidente José Jeri.\n\n“Nosotros teníamos nuestro punto de encuentro en Acho y contamos con el oficio enviado por la ATU. Hay una clara descoordinación con la Policía: ellos son quienes están generando el caos y el desorden. (…) Esto demuestra que el Gobierno no tiene intención de solucionar los problemas”, declaró.\n\nUno de los representantes del gremio de transportistas denunció que, tras el asesinato de José Johnny Esqueche Ningles, ocurrido el 27 de octubre, cuando fue atacado a balazos mientras conducía su unidad de la empresa Liventur en la avenida Néstor Gambetta, la situación de inseguridad no ha mejorado.\n\n\"En el caso de Ventanilla, con el asesinato de Johnny Esqueche, primero estaba la banda ‘Tito’, luego ‘Los Chuckys’; supuestamente capturaron a esa banda y después apareció otra. Hay varias organizaciones que se pelean para extorsionar a los trabajadores\", explicó.\n\nElmer Mercado, miembro del sindicato de trabajadores del transporte, aseguró que el sector no está debidamente representado en el Congreso de la República, ya que no fueron invitados a dialogar con las autoridades para frenar la ola de extorsiones.\n\n\"Nosotros como trabajadores no estamos representados. Tenemos ideas para combatir la delincuencia, pero nunca nos invitaron, nos pusieron la valla (...) a nosotros nos ven como los enemigos\", lamentó.\n\nMartín Ojeda, director de la Cámara Internacional de la Industria del Transporte, precisó que se levantarán los bloqueos de buses, los cuales se estacionaron en puntos estratégicos de la ciudad en señal de protesta, para dar paso a una reunión entre los transportistas y las autoridades. Foto: La República\n\nUna mujer increpó al general Óscar Arriola Delgado, comandante general de la Policía Nacional del Perú (PNP) tras finalizar la reunión del presidente Jeri y otras autoridades sobre los acuerdos del paro de transportistas.\n\n“General Arriola, nos están matando todos los días. Nos extorsionan, no es justo. Los choferes están dejando a sus hijitos en la orfandad. Quiero que actúen, estamos cansados de que el Perú siga derramando sangre”, expresó la mujer, visiblemente angustiada.\n\nLos buses de las empresas Las Águilas, la 10E y San Germán fueron bloqueados por efectivos policiales en su paso hacia el óvalo Zárate, en San Juan de Lurigancho. La Policía Nacional del Perú restringe el tránsito para garantizar la circulación de las unidades del Corredor Morado y Azul.\n\nEl Ministerio de Salud (Minsa) anunció que sus servicios han iniciado la atención con normalidad en los hospitales de Lima, incluyendo las áreas de consulta externa, intervenciones, hospitalización y emergencia. Asimismo, informó que quienes no pudieron acudir a sus citas podrán reprogramarlas y se ofrecerán las facilidades correspondientes.\n\nUn grupo de transportistas de las empresas Lipetsa y Etupsa obligó a bajar a los pasajeros de los buses que no acataron el paro, a la altura de la Panamericana Norte y el óvalo Izaguirre. Durante la protesta, los manifestantes gritaron consignas como “¡Capturen a los delincuentes!” y se registraron enfrentamientos con efectivos policiales, quienes impidieron que los manifestantes avanzaran hacia el centro de Lima y priorizaron el tránsito de otras unidades que no paralizaron.\n\nLa ATU informó que, debido al cierre de la plaza de Acho, la ruta 370 del Corredor Azul llegará solo hasta el jirón Loreto y retornará por el jirón Marañón hacia su paradero inicial, ubicado en Mónaco, en el distrito del Rímac.\n\nAlgunas unidades de las empresas La 50, Loritos y Nueva América permanecen estacionadas en el puente de Acho. Los choferes protestan portando carteles y pancartas con mensajes como “Solo quiero trabajar”, “Si tocan a uno, respondemos todos” y “Por la vida”, entre otros, en demanda de mayor seguridad.\n\nLos transportistas de ETRASCPSA, conocida como la empresa 10E, se concentraron en la avenida Próceres de la Independencia, en San Juan de Lurigancho. En el lugar se registraron enfrentamientos entre los manifestantes y agentes de la Policía Nacional del Perú. Los conductores aseguran que no se les permite avanzar para ejercer su derecho a la protesta, mientras que los efectivos policiales sostienen que buscan garantizar el tránsito de otros vehículos y del Corredor Morado.\n\nDiversas unidades de las empresas ETUPSA 73 y Lipetsa se concentraron en el óvalo Izaguirre, en el sentido norte a sur. Ambas compañías bloquearon los accesos en el cruce de la Panamericana Norte con la avenida Izaguirre.\n\nEl presidente José Jeri llegó hasta el puente de Acho, en el distrito del Rímac, donde se instaló el Módulo Itinerante de Seguridad (MIS). Estuvo acompañado por el alcalde Néstor de la Rosa, el primer ministro, Ernesto Álvarez y el dirigente transportista, Martín Ojeda. La comitiva realizó una supervisión del paro de transportistas, junto a otras autoridades, en medio de un amplio despliegue de seguridad.\n\nConductores de las distintas líneas de la empresa de transporte ETRASCPSA denunciaron que no se les permitió avanzar, pese a contar con autorización del Gobierno. La caravana de buses se encuentran bloqueando la avenida Próceres de la Independencia, en el ingreso al distrito de San Juan de Lurigancho. La Policía impidió que los buses continúen su recorrido hacia el Centro de Lima como parte de las medidas de protestas.\n\nLa Autoridad de Transporte Urbano para Lima y Callao (ATU) alerta que, a causa del cierre del óvalo Zárate por el paro de transportistas, el corredor Morado ha desviado su recorrido en dirección al Centro de Lima por las avenidas Pirámide del Sol, Evitamiento, el jirón Loreto y la avenida Abancay.\n\nBuses de transporte público de las empresas 41, Etupsa 73 y \"La 1” partieron desde el distrito de Villa El Salvador para sumarse, de forma pacífica, al paro de transportistas. Las unidades partieron desde la avenida Revolución con Lomas con dirección al Congreso de la República.\n\nActualmente, se encuentran en los alrededores del óvalo Habich con los motores apagados como parte de las medidas de protesta.\n\nDurante las primeras horas de la mañana del 4 de noviembre, en el distrito de El Agustino, a la altura de Puente Nuevo, diversas empresas de transporte iniciaron el apagado de motores como medida de protesta ante la inacción del Estado frente al aumento de extorsiones y asesinatos contra conductores del gremio de transporte público. Créditos: Marco Cotrina / La República\n\nEn el distrito de Carabayllo, supuestos manifestantes quemaron llantas y otros objetos en el kilómetro 24 de la avenida Túpac Amaru. Agentes de la Policía llegaron a la zona, que presentaba una alta congestión por vehículos de carga pesada, con el objetivo de extinguir las llamas y reanudar el tránsito vehicular en sentido hacia el sur.\n\nEn medio del paro de transportistas, diversas unidades de las empresas de transportes Nueva América y Virgen de la Puerta decidieron bloquear la avenida Túpac Amaru, en el distrito de Carabayllo.\n\nLos vehículos exhiben mensajes en los que se exige justicia y se demandan medidas drásticas al Estado contra la inseguridad. Uno de los buses muestra la imagen de uno de los conductores que fue víctima de extorsión.\n\nUna caravana de unidades de la empresa de transporte Lipetsa, también conocida como “El Triángulo” se desplaza por un solo carril de la Vía de Evitamiento, cerca del puente Acho, bajo resguardo de agentes de la Policía Nacional del Perú.\n\nLos conductores exigen justicia luego de que uno de sus compañeros fuera asesinado en el distrito de San Juan de Miraflores.\n\nEl Seguro Social de Salud (EsSalud) informa a la ciudadanía que las personas aseguradas que no puedan asistir a sus citas programadas este 4 de noviembre en los distintos centros médicos y hospitales podrán reprogramarlas a través de las líneas oficiales de la institución.\n\nEl Ministerio del Interior (Mininter) comunicó que la Policía Nacional del Perú (PNP) ha dispuesto 21 buses para facilitar el transporte del público en distintos puntos de Lima. La institución aclaró que el servicio es totalmente gratuito.\n\nVecinos del distrito de San Martín de Porres reportan escasa presencia de unidades de transporte público. Por otro lado, algunas unidades de la Empresa de Transporte Urbano Los Chinos (Etuchisa) circulan en la avenida Panamericana en ambos sentidos.\n\nEn declaraciones para La República, Miguel Palomino, presidente de la Asociación Nacional de Conductores, aseguró que el paro del 4 de noviembre “es un éxito”. No obstante, indicó que, hasta el momento, el Gobierno de José Jerí no ha establecido una mesa de trabajo para resolver el pliego de reclamos de los transportistas. Además, exigió que el Congreso revise las leyes que, según considera, favorecen a la criminalidad.\n\n“Estas leyes blindan a los criminales. Primero deben eliminar estas leyes”, enfatizó.\n\nEn Rimac, vecinos reportan escasa presencia de vehículos de transporte público en las inmediaciones de la Vía de Evitamiento. Además, se registran combis y colectivos que recogen pasajeros en el paradero del puente Ricardo Palma\n\nEn el Callo, usuarios reportan alta congestión vehicular en la avenida Gambetta con dirección a Lima. Unidades de transporte público y vehículos privados invaden ambos sentidos de la vía.\n\nLa estación Los Jardines, ubicada en San Juan de Lurigancho, presenta una escasa afluencia de usuarios en sus instalaciones. Desde las primeras horas del día, en el paradero La Hacienda, se observa un notable flujo de transporte informal en los paraderos cercanos, mientras que la presencia de líneas de transporte formal es escasa.\n\nEn Puente Nuevo, los usuarios se concentran en grandes grupos a la espera de buses que los lleven a sus destinos laborales, en el contexto del paro de transportistas previsto para este martes 4 de noviembre. En este momento, solo operan Los Chinos y combis informales, que circulan al 200% de su capacidad. Además, se observa la presencia de la Policía Nacional del Perú (PNP) en la zona.\n\nEn Puente Piedra, calle Las Palmeras, se encuentra el paradero inicial de \"Los Chinos\", perteneciente a la empresa Etuchisa, que ha confirmado que acatará el paro de transportistas. En la zona, efectivos policiales resguardan el área, asegurando el orden público. Hasta el momento, ninguna unidad de la mencionada empresa ha salido a operar. No obstante, otras empresas han comenzado a prestar servicio.\n\nLa Dirección Regional de Educación de Lima Metropolitana (DRELM) emitió un nuevo comunicado, dejando sin efecto una disposición anterior y estableciendo que este martes 4 de noviembre las clases en todas las instituciones educativas públicas se desarrollen de manera remota. Esta decisión se toma en resguardo de la seguridad de la comunidad educativa y aplica también a los colegios privados, aunque estos últimos podrán adoptar medidas adicionales en el marco de su autonomía.\n\nEn Ancón, la situación del transporte se ha visto afectada por el paro de este martes 4 de noviembre. En este contexto, solo los Anconeros informales han salido a operar, lo que ha generado un aumento en las tarifas que cobran, según han manifestado varios pasajeros. Ante esta situación, algunos usuarios han decidido recurrir a los colectivos como alternativa para desplazarse. Personal de las Fuerzas Armadas se encuentran custodiando la zona.\n\nEste martes 4 de noviembre, la Línea 1 del Metro operará entre las 5:00 a. m. y las 10:00 p. m., mientras que la Línea 2 funcionará desde las 6:00 a. m. hasta las 11:00 p. m. Por su parte, el servicio AeroDirecto operará las 24 horas del día, como lo hace de manera habitual\n\nMartín Ojeda, director de la Cámara Internacional de la Industria del Transporte, confirmó que el martes 4 de noviembre se llevará a cabo el paro nacional de transportistas. Esta medida tiene como objetivo exigir al Gobierno respuestas efectivas ante la creciente inseguridad que afecta al sector. “El apagado de motores y la marcha van”, afirmó el dirigente.\n\nOjeda denunció que, a pesar del estado de emergencia, los ataques contra conductores y empresarios del transporte siguen sin control en diversas áreas de Lima y en provincias. “Nos siguen matando y extorsionando. No hay una presencia policial efectiva ni una estrategia sólida para proteger a los trabajadores del volante”, manifestó.\n\nTambién destacó que la paralización incluirá una marcha pacífica, en la que participarán representantes de distintos gremios de transporte urbano, interprovincial y de carga pesada. “Este paro no es político ni busca desestabilizar al Gobierno. Es un grito de paz ante tanta violencia”, concluyó.\n\nEl instituto Zegel anunció que sus clases y la atención del Servicio de Atención al Estudiante (SAE) programadas para el martes 04 de noviembre en todos los campus de Lima se desarrollarán exclusivamente de manera virtual. Esta medida preventiva se toma para salvaguardar la integridad física de los estudiantes ante el paro de transportistas programado para esa fecha.\n\nEl 6 de octubre, transportistas llevaron a cabo una protesta significativa en Lima y Callao, realizando un “paro de motores” que afectó la movilidad de miles de ciudadanos. Al día siguiente, los líderes del sector alcanzaron un acuerdo con el Gobierno, que establecía un plazo de 15 días para implementar medidas de seguridad. No obstante, ante el incremento de amenazas y asesinatos, decidieron convocar a una nueva paralización. A pesar de que el presidente José Jerí declaró el estado de emergencia el 22 de octubre y movilizó a fuerzas policiales y militares en las calles, el Sistema de Defunciones (SINADEF) reportó 28 homicidios relacionados con el sector en un lapso de apenas 15 días.\n\nA pocas horas del paro de transporte, se registró un violento hecho. Un bus de la empresa ETUL4SA, de la ruta San Juan de Lurigancho - Chorrillos, fue atacada en la cuadra 3 de la av. Guardia Civil, en la urb. La Campiña, del distrito chorrillano. El hecho ocurrió alrededor de las 9:00 p.m., a la altura del mercado Santa Rosa, en la zona conocida como La Curva. Testigos señalaron que al menos tres disparos impactaron contra el vehículo, y que los perpetradores iban a borde de una motocicleta.\n\nSegún Martín Ojeda, vocero de Transportistas Unidos, la medida será acatada por unidades de Lima norte, centro, este y sur. Entre las empresas y gremios que participarán se encuentran:\n\n- Asociación Nacional de Conductores Profesionales del Perú (ANCPP)\n\n- Corporación Nacional de Empresas de Transporte (Conet Perú)\n\nEl Ministerio de Trabajo y Promoción del Empleo (MTPE) emitió un comunicado ante el paro convocado por los transportistas para el 4 de noviembre, exhortando a los empleadores a priorizar el teletrabajo. Asimismo, informó que los trabajadores afectados por la falta de transporte público tendrán una tolerancia de hasta dos horas en su hora de ingreso.\n\nLa empresa Inversiones y Representaciones Polo S.A.C., conocida popularmente como “Los Loritos” y que cubre la ruta de Ate a Ventanilla, anunció que suspenderá sus servicios por 24 horas este 4 de noviembre, en apoyo al paro convocado por los gremios de transporte urbano.\n\nEl Gobierno promulgó una ley que establece medidas extraordinarias contra la extorsión y el sicariato en el sector transporte, en medio de las tensiones por el paro nacional anunciado por gremios de transportistas. La norma busca reforzar la coordinación entre la Policía Nacional, el Ministerio de Transportes y la Superintendencia de Banca y Seguros, además de crear un registro nacional de empresas vulnerables y fomentar el intercambio de información para detectar redes de lavado de activos.\n\nEl presidente Jerí afirmó que la norma marca un “punto de quiebre” en la lucha contra el crimen organizado. Sin embargo, especialistas advierten que su efectividad dependerá de la asignación de recursos y de la coordinación entre las autoridades, especialmente en regiones como Trujillo, Chiclayo y Lima, donde las extorsiones han paralizado rutas y causado pérdidas económicas.\n\nLa ATU informó que las Líneas 1 y 2 del Metro de Lima operarán con total normalidad durante la jornada del martes 4 de noviembre. Asimismo, precisó que el servicio del Aerodirecto también mantendrá su horario habitual de atención, detallado a continuación:\n\nLa Autoridad de Transporte Urbano para Lima y Callao (ATU) informó que los horarios de transporte funcionaran con normalidad el 4 de noviembre. Mediante un comunicado, la institución afirmó que se \"garantiza la operatividad al 100 %\" de los diversos servicios que supervisa.\n\nMetropolitano y corredores: de 5:00 a. m. a 11:00 p. m.\n\nLa Empresa de Transporte Nueva América S.A., que cubre rutas hacia el Callao, Carabayllo y San Juan de Miraflores, anunció que suspenderá sus servicios por 24 horas este martes 4 de noviembre.\n\n“Exigimos justicia y la captura de los responsables. Además, demandamos una pensión mensual y beneficios para las madres e hijos de los conductores asesinados por estas organizaciones criminales”, expresó la compañía.\n\nLa empresa de transportes Cruz del Centro S.A. anunció que la Línea 2 suspenderá sus servicios el martes 4 de noviembre, señalando: “Nos unimos al paro general en rechazo a las extorsiones y amenazas que vienen sufriendo los transportistas.”\n\nLa empresa de transporte urbano ETUCHISA, conocida como Los Chinos, junto con ETYSM El Cóndor S.A.C., anunciaron que se unirán al paro de transportistas convocado para el martes 4 de noviembre.\n\n“Mostramos nuestra total indignación, preocupación y alarma ante la inacción del Gobierno, ya que no observamos ninguna medida concreta pese a las marchas, plazos y reuniones sostenidas anteriormente”, expresaron a través de un comunicado.\n\nLa empresa de transporte La 50, que cubre la ruta San Juan de Lurigancho–Callao, anunció que suspenderá sus servicios por 24 horas este martes 4 de noviembre, “en señal de duelo y solidaridad por el atentado contra nuestros compañeros conductores Leoncio Sandoval Castro, de la ET Mariscal Ramón Castilla, y José Esqueche Ningles, de la empresa Liventur”.\n\nLa empresa de transporte El Rápido S.A. anunció que suspenderá sus operaciones el martes 4 de noviembre, \"en cumplimiento de los acuerdos adoptados por los gremios de transportistas de los conos Norte, Sur y Este\". La medida cuenta con el respaldo de las diferentes líneas que integran la compañía y operan en diversas rutas de Lima.\n\nLa Dirección Regional de Educación de Lima Metropolitana (DRELM) informó que este martes 4 de noviembre las clases en las instituciones educativas públicas se desarrollarán de manera presencial.\n\nLa medida también alcanza a los colegios privados, aunque —en el marco de su autonomía— podrán decidir medidas propias para proteger la seguridad de su comunidad educativa y asegurar el normal desarrollo de las actividades escolares.\n\nLa Empresa de Transporte Unidos de Pasajeros S.A., conocida como \'Etupsa 73\' anunció que se unirán al paro de transportistas convocado para el 4 de noviembre. \"Exigimos acciones firmes y efectivas por parte del Estado para detener esta ola de crímenes que amenaza nuestras vidas y nuestro trabajo\", se lee en el comunicado.\n\nMartín Ojeda, dirigente transportista, anunció ante los medios —tras una reunión en Palacio de Gobierno con representantes del sector— que realizarán un apagado de motores como medida de protesta. “Mañana vamos a apagar motores desde las 5:00 a.m. hasta las 12:00 (...). No nos hemos olvidado de los chóferes asesinados”, declaró.\n\nAlgunas universidades de Lima han decidido suspender sus actividades académicas presenciales y optar temporalmente por la modalidad virtual.\n\nTras una reunión con el Ejecutivo, el dirigente transportistas, Ricardo Pareja, informó que ocho gremios de transporte urbano decidieron no sumarse a la paralización. Además, señaló que se están coordinando acciones conjuntas con los ministerios del Interior y de Transportes y Comunicaciones para combatir la extorsión y reducir la informalidad en el sector. - Cámara de Transporte Urbano de Lima y Callao - Coordinadora de Transporte Urbano - Anitra - Corporación de Transporte Urbano - Asistraca - Conecsa - Ametur - Ugtranm Entre las propuestas que se impulsan se encuentra la implementación de políticas orientadas al cambio de matriz energética y a la modernización del transporte urbano, entre otras.\n\nMartín Ojeda ratificó que el gremio realizará un “apagado de motores” y una movilización pacífica para exigir medidas efectivas frente a la creciente inseguridad ciudadana. Asimismo, precisó que no se bloquearán avenidas ni calles, pues el objetivo principal es visibilizar la violencia que enfrentan diariamente los conductores y cobradores del sector transporte.\n\nPor su parte, el presidente de la Cámara de Transporte Urbano de Lima y Callao, Ricardo Pareja Fonseca, señaló que el 95% de las empresas formales de transporte urbano no acatará el paro, luego de mantener una reunión con el ministro de Transportes y Comunicaciones, Aldo Prieto Barreda.\n\n', '/uploads/news/scraped-515192ffd67dbc9abce2280ac4e166b9.webp', 'https://larepublica.pe/sociedad/2025/11/04/paro-de-transportistas-del-4-de-noviembre-en-vivo-se-reportan-enfrentamientos-bloquean-rutas-y-realizan-caravana-hasta-el-centro-de-lima-40288', 'scraped', '2025-11-05 03:10:50', 1, 0, 3, NULL, '2025-11-05 03:10:50', '2025-11-05 03:10:50'),

Ello debido al uso de una cámara del Congreso durante el mitín de la lideresa de Fuerza Popular, Keiko Fujimori, el 30 de octubre en Trujillo, cuando se anunció su cuarta precandidatura presidencial.\n\nDe acuerdo con la resolución N.º 00097-2025-JEE-PCYO/JNE al que tuvo acceso La República, el 3 de noviembre, la coordinadora de fiscalización adscrita al JEE presentó dos informes en los que, según indican, los dos funcionarios públicos presuntamente infringieron \"las normas que regulan la neutralidad estatal en el periodo electoral, (…) debido al uso indebido de bienes públicos, a favor de la organización política Fuerza Popular\".\n\nPUEDES VER: César Combina: Poder Judicial ordena ubicación y captura de excongresista por ausentarse en juicio\n\nEn ese sentido, el JEE les otorgó hasta un día de plazo para brindar sus descargos luego de haber recibido la notificación a través de la mesa de partes del Congreso.\n\nAdemás, el organismo electoral dispuso que Rospigliosi y Forno habiliten una casilla electrónica en el portal del Jurado Nacional de Elecciones (JNE) para que puedan recibir notificaciones que emita el Jurado Electoral Especial.\n\nPUEDES VER: Gobierno aprueba ley para juzgar como adultos a menores de 16 y 17 años por crímenes graves\n\nPrecisamente, sobre Rospigliosi se prepara una moción de censura en el Parlamento.

El informe N.º 38-2025-LCC-JEEPACASMAYO-EG2026/JNE advierte que el oficial mayor del Congreso \"no cauteló el uso adecuado de una cámara institucional, la cual fue empleada para filmar la actividad política de la organización Fuerza Popular\". Dicho acto, señala el informe, \"configura una infracción al artículo 32 del Reglamento sobre propaganda electoral\"; es decir, al principio de neutralidad.\n\n\"La conducta del Oficial Mayor se adecua al tipo infractor por omisión impropia, al no haber activado mecanismos de control, trazabilidad ni prevención sobre el uso de bienes públicos bajo su competencia, vulnerando el principio de neutralidad electoral y el deber de vigilancia institucional\", se lee en el documento.\n\nMientras que, por el lado de Rospigliosi, el informe resalta que este tiene \"el deber inexcusable de garantizar que los bienes públicos bajo su custodia —como las cámaras institucionales inventariadas— sean utilizados exclusivamente para los fines propios de la función legislativa\".\n\nEn ese sentido, el informe de fiscalización señala que \"la omisión del presidente del Congreso en cautelar el uso adecuado de los bienes institucionales, y deslindar oportunamente la responsabilidad funcional, evidencia un incumplimiento de sus deberes de vigilancia y control\".\n\nInforme de fiscalización 38-2025-LCC-JEEPACASMAYO-EG2026/JNE\n\nAdemás, el JEE considera que el comunicado emitido por la Oficialía Mayor el 2 de noviembre, si bien reconoce la existencia de una presunta inconducta funcional y anuncia la apertura de un procedimiento administrativo sancionador, \"no constituye un deslinde de responsabilidad respecto a otros funcionarios con deberes de vigilancia y control\" del oficial mayor y Rospigiliosi.\n\nPor otro lado, el informe N.° 000038-2025-LCC-JEEPACASMAYO-EG2026/JNE complementa el informe antes señalado e incorpora el análisis del artículo 33 del Reglamento sobre Propaganda Electoral, Publicidad Estatal y Neutralidad en Periodo Electoral, sobre una eventual vulneración al principio de neutralidad de los trabajadores mientras ejercían funciones.\n\nEl informe recalca que, a pesar de que el trabajador del Congreso implicado renunció a su cargo tras revelarse la información, ello \"no extingue la responsabilidad administrativa ni penal derivada de los hechos ocurridos\".\n\nAdemás, conforme al principio de continuidad del procedimiento sancionador, el JEE puede seguir investigando los hechos a pesar de la dimisión del trabajador. \"En este sentido, se aplica el aforismo jurídico “Renuntiatio non est absolutio”, es decir, la renuncia no equivale a absolución\", indica el documento.\n\n\"Asimismo, el comunicado emitido por la Oficialía Mayor el 2 de noviembre de 2025, si bien reconoce la existencia de una presunta inconducta funcional y anuncia la apertura de un procedimiento administrativo sancionador, no constituye un deslinde de responsabilidad respecto de otros funcionarios con deberes de vigilancia y control, como el Oficial Mayor y el Presidente del Congreso\", agrega el informe.\n\nRenuncia de trabajador involucrado no equivale a una absolución, señala informe de fiscalización\n\nEl 2 de noviembre, Rospigliosi minimizó el hecho a una \"falta\" cometida por un trabajador de la entidad.

En solo una semana, con el aval del Gobierno de José Jerí, el Congreso logró que se promulgue la ley de creación de otras seis universidades públicas, por lo que la cifra total se elevó a 47 nuevas casas de estudio fundadas entre julio del 2021 y noviembre del 2025.\n\nResulta que, entre el 28 de octubre y el 2 de noviembre últimos, se han creado las universidades nacionales del Vraem de Kimbiri (Cusco), de Huaral, de Huaycán (Lima), de Talara (Piura); así como la de Arte de Áncash y la de Arte de Piura, las mismas que antes eran escuelas de formación artística.\n\nPUEDES VER: Waldemar Cerrón pide un periodo de gracia de 15 años para las 40 universidades que este Congreso creó sin sustento\n\nEstas nuevas casas de estudio se suman a las 41 que ya habían sido reportadas por La República, de las cuales 20 fueron promulgadas de un solo porrazo por el Congreso pese a que su autógrafa de ley había observada por el Ejecutivo porque implicaba un gasto creciente para el presupuesto del Estado que puede comprometer la sostenibilidad fiscal a largo plazo.\n\nEste es un nuevo récord porque en ningún otro periodo legislativo de nuestra historia republicana se han creado tantas universidades públicas como en el actual. Y es que casi se ha duplicado el número de las hoy existentes (49 licenciadas). Ya solo faltan dos para contar con 98 universidades estatales a nivel nacional.\n\nLa diferencia es abismal con el periodo legislativo 2006-2011, del Gobierno de Alan García, en el que se abrieron 16 universidades públicas, de las cuales 14 siguen con comisiones organizadoras y dos existen solo en papeles (en SJL y Los Olivos).\n\nSegún especialistas consultados, el problema es que estas universidades no se abrirán en un corto plazo por falta presupuesto, lo que termina siendo un ‘engañamuchachos’.\n\n“Los congresistas están en una carrera populista e irresponsable en la búsqueda de su reelección. No pueden jugar con las expectativas de los jóvenes de regiones”, cuestionó el exministro de Educación, Idel Vexler.\n\nBasándose en un informe técnico del Minedu, las exministras Marilú Martens y Miriam Ponce advirtieron que para abrir una sola universidad pública con tres carreras y sin laboratorios se requieren 105 millones de soles, ya que el 90% va para infraestructura.\n\nEso quiere decir que para estas 47 nuevas universidades se necesitarían 4.935 millones de soles solo para el año cero, sin considerar los gastos del licenciamiento. Dicho monto representaría la cuarta parte del presupuesto del sector Educación del 2025, consistente en 20.000 millones de soles.\n\nLo preocupante es que, para asegurar esos recursos, se deberían recortar los gastos referido a la infraestructura de colegios, pago de docentes y programas de educación. “No existe un plan integral que asegure la calidad y sostenibilidad de estas universidades creadas. Además, la cifra representa un reto presupuestal que no está contemplado en el proyecto de presupuesto nacional”, afirmó la exministra Martens.\n\nLa Asociación de Universidades Nacionales del Perú (Aunap) criticó que el Congreso esté creando universidades de papel y que el Ejecutivo esté abandonando a las actuales universidades licenciadas al recortarles presupuesto por segundo año consecutivo.\n\nLa Aunap exhortó al Parlamento aprobar una moratoria en la creación de nuevas universidades públicas hasta garantizar el financiamiento de las que ya funcionan. “Se aprueban estas normas cuando el Ejecutivo pretende recortar el presupuesto del 2026 de las universidades, lo que afectaría a más de 363.000 jóvenes estudiantes”, respondió.\n\n“Este Congreso dejará una bomba de tiempo al siguiente Gobierno. Las poblaciones locales van a estar exacerbadas cuando vean que las nuevas universidades no se abrirán en el corto plazo”, explicó el exfuncionario del Minedu, Jorge Mori, quien es hoy director del Centro para el Análisis de Políticas Públicas de Educación Superior (Cappes).\n\nMori afirmó que 14 universidades creadas entre el 2006 y 2011 tardaron siete años, en promedio, para entrar en funcionamiento y aún siguen con comisiones organizadoras por la poca oferta de docentes investigadores en esas localidades.\n\n“Si el Congreso se va creando 47 nuevas universidades públicas habrá 96 en el Perú, si sumamos a las 49 ya existentes y licenciadas. Eso es inviable. Acá hay populismo y aprovechamiento político y se burlan de las poblaciones de regiones”, lamentó.\n\n', '/uploads/news/scraped-5d84f72835ba3fcd57296b0758aafb80.webp', 'https://larepublica.pe/politica/2025/11/05/populismo-en-el-congreso-en-una-semana-se-crearon-otras-6-universidades-y-ya-van-47-nuevas-en-solo-4-anos-hnews-330730', 'scraped', '2025-11-07 04:08:56', 1, 0, 3, NULL, '2025-11-07 04:08:56', '2025-11-07 04:08:56'),

El jefe del regulador manifestó el apetito de nuevos bancos y entidades que buscan ingresar al sector financiero del país, propiamente por tres factores.\n\n—¿Cuál es su evaluación del avance regulatorio de la SBS durante este año?\n\nCreo que se ha avanzado en varios aspectos. Estamos plasmando un marco regulatorio más atractivo, flexible y comprensivo, según los distintos sectores que supervisa la SBS. En general, se están generando mejores condiciones para el desarrollo de los mercados.\n\nPUEDES VER: IPAE, organizador de CADE critica ausentismo de candidatos presidenciales: \"No asistir y no dialogar con los empresarios es escapismo\"\n\n— ¿Qué normas considera que han sido las más importantes?\n\nYo creo que el desarrollo de la ley de reforma al sistema de pensiones que vamos a publicar en versión definitiva en noviembre para la entrada de nuevos actores, ya sea del sector financiero o de seguros para que administren fondos de pensiones. Es un elemento fundamental. Si se logra darle mayor grado de competencia al sistema de fondos de pensiones, eso va a ser un aspecto muy positivo para todo el Perú.\n\nTambién tenemos el proyecto de Open Banking (banca abierta), que creemos que en el mediano y largo plazo, va a ser un elemento muy favorable para la mayor competencia del sistema y una mayor inclusión financiera.\n\nPUEDES VER: CEO de Casa Andina: \"El turismo sigue rezagado, pero ahora hay mejor diálogo entre ministros de Cultura y Comercio Exterior\"\n\nTambién estamos por prepublicar una nueva norma de provisiones para las empresas financieras (reservas que las entidades apartan para cubrir pérdidas de sus créditos) que apunta a hacer un cálculo mucho más vinculado a la pérdida esperada que a tablas preestablecidas.\n\nSe han dado varias medidas para incentivar el crecimiento de las cooperativas y todavía vamos a dar algunas más que creemos va a permitir la estabilización definitiva del sector.\n\n— Sobre la ley de reforma de pensiones, ¿Cuáles son los aspectos técnicos que considera urgentes?\n\nEl más importante es la entrada de nuevos actores a la administración de fondos de pensiones, y eso está en marcha. Ahora, a la par, hay que reglamentar la ley vigente, porque no olvidemos que se derogaron solo dos aspectos, pero todo lo demás continúa: por ejemplo, la pensión mínima y la afiliación a los 18 años. Hay una serie de cosas que están en la ley que deben reglamentarse, algunas en conjunto con la ONP, con la cual ya estamos trabajando. También ha quedado claro que existen algunos vacíos y brechas que deben cubrirse.\n\nNo hay que olvidar que en el Perú existe el sistema privado, el de la ONP, el de militares y policías. Pero la cobertura en general de los adultos mayores no es mayoritaria, debido a las condiciones del mercado laboral y la poca frecuencia de los aportes. En general, no tenemos una cantidad suficiente de adultos que llegan a la edad de retiro con alguna forma de jubilación, y eso hace que la población no sienta como suyo el sistema de pensiones.\n\nLacobertura de los adultos mayores no es mayoritaria, debido a las condiciones del mercado laboral y la poca frecuencia de los aportes, señala la SBS.\n\nCreemos que eso hay que revertirlo, y para eso estamos trabajando una propuesta técnica interna. Se ha conformado un grupo de trabajo cuya meta es entregar el próximo año un estudio con todas las alternativas de mejora, no solo para el sistema privado, sino para todo el sistema pensionario del Perú. La idea es ponerlo en discusión y tratar de alcanzar un sistema de protección para la jubilación que sea consensuado.\n\nPUEDES VER: CADE Ejecutivos 2025: empresarios proyectan un crecimiento económico del 3,2% en 2026\n\nYo creo que a más tardar el primer semestre. Esa es la idea, porque estamos trabajando con una visión multi-enfoque, sin descartar ninguna alternativa. Analizamos todas las posibilidades. Lo que ha hecho Chile recientemente, lo que sucede en otros países y cuánto cuesta implementar esos cambios. Es un trabajo complejo, pero la meta es que, a más tardar el primer semestre, podamos ponerlo sobre la mesa para una discusión más amplia.\n\n—¿Ha recibido el interés de algunas entidades financieras que quieran ingresar a competir en el mercado de fondos de pensiones?\n\nSí, hemos recibido ese tipo de inquietudes. Esto ocurrió antes de aprobarse la ley del octavo retiro AFP. Antes de eso habíamos recibido hasta tres expresiones de interés en entrar, obviamente dependiendo de las condiciones. Por eso mencionaba la norma que publicaremos en noviembre, cuya meta es tener un procedimiento muy flexible, ágil y rápido para que esos interesados puedan ingresar rápidamente al negocio de administración de fondos de pensiones. Para lo cual, estamos trabajando además en flexibilizar el marco regulatorio actual de las AFP, haciéndolo más basado en riesgo y menos en control inmediato, lo que también hará más atractivo el ingreso de nuevos competidores, junto con la centralización de procesos.\n\nLa gran pregunta es si con el octavo retiro AFP —y la posibilidad de que haya más adelante otros— ¿eso va a desalentar la entrada de nuevos competidores? Esperemos que no. Estamos tratando de contrarrestar ese efecto con medidas que hagan más eficiente, rápida y económica la entrada de competidores, y por lo tanto más atractivo el mercado.\n\nSi, por ejemplo, soy un grupo empresarial que no tiene un negocio de administración de fondos de pensiones, y sale la ley de reforma, puedo decir \"esto está interesante, veamos cómo la superintendencia lo reglamenta\". Si me dicen que tengo que crear una AFP nueva, no tiene sentido, es muy caro. Pero si el reglamento es positivo, flexible y eficiente, puedo estar interesado en entrar. Sin embargo, si en ese interín se aprueba un octavo retiro, entonces digo, ¿Voy a entrar a qué, si no habrá dinero que administrar en algún momento?\".\n\nSi contrarrestamos eso con medidas que hagan más eficiente la competencia, más flexible la entrada y más lógica la regulación, ese riesgo puede atenuarse, porque la decisión de inversión puede no ser tan costosa. Ahora, eso no atenúa el hecho de que el dinero que ya no está en las cuentas de las personas no estará disponible al momento de su jubilación. Ese dinero se fue y ya no va a estar cuando lo necesiten en la vejez.\n\n— En su análisis, más allá de las AFP, ¿Qué entidades cree que pueden quitarle parte de esa torta de participación?\n\nLa ley permite la entrada de aseguradoras, bancos y cajas. De hecho, una o más cajas municipales han expresado directamente su interés. Creemos que las cajas aportan un ingrediente regional que también es muy interesante a la hora de generar relación con sus clientes.\n\nEn el caso de las aseguradoras, hay muchas semejanzas porque ofrecen rentas vitalicias, tanto para jubilación como de inversión. Hay una complementariedad bastante clara entre el negocio asegurador y el de administración de fondos de pensiones. Por eso queremos que los marcos que regulan las inversiones de ambos tipos de empresas sean más parecidos. Tienen que tener diferencias por su naturaleza, pero no deberían ser tan distintos como ahora; si son más cercanos, ambos negocios pueden ser más eficientes.\n\n—¿Cree que la competencia puede ayudar a reducir la desconfianza ciudadana hacia el sistema de pensiones?\n\nLa principal acción es empezar a generar pensiones que la gente valore. La competencia es importante, y si tiene un efecto en los costos, también lo es. Pero es difícil contrarrestar un incentivo muy claro: la gente, por naturaleza, quiere tener el dinero hoy y no mañana. Eso es natural, sobre todo en familias cuyos ingresos son bajos y no les sobra dinero. En ese contexto, inculcar el hábito del ahorro para la vejez es difícil, pero fundamental.\n\n¿Cómo se logra? No tanto por el lado de la competencia, sino por el retorno. Si generamos sistemas que otorguen pensiones dignas para la mayoría, eso le dará legitimidad al sistema. La gente verá que sus familiares mayores pueden vivir decentemente de sus pensiones sin depender del resto de la familia.\n\n— Tenemos una elevada informalidad, donde los ingresos son bajos y por ende el aporte a su pensión es bajo\n\nSí, pero si uno ve la data, aunque eso es cierto, hay ejemplos que muestran que es posible avanzar. En salud, por ejemplo, muchos afiliados a EsSalud no son trabajadores en planilla ni están obligados, pero se afilian porque valoran tener cobertura médica. Esa misma valoración debemos fomentar respecto a la vejez, porque es una necesidad real. El día que una persona tenga 65 o 70 años ya no podrá generar los mismos ingresos, y si no tiene familia que la ampare, ¿de qué vivirá? Hay que guardar pan para mayo.\n\n—Señala que hay un mayor apetito de entidades financieras por ingresar al país. ¿Por qué se da ahora a diferencia de otros años?\n\nHay varias razones. La primera, probablemente la más importante, es el entorno económico. Cuando un país tiene un entorno abierto y favorable, con crecimiento del PBI, eso favorece la inversión. Si las condiciones no fueran favorables, nadie invertiría. En segundo lugar, la digitalización. Hoy la ley peruana permite constituir un banco o cualquier empresa supervisada por la SBS de manera completamente digital.\n\nLo que antes implicaba grandes inversiones en oficinas y redes, hoy se enfoca en tecnología, seguridad y personal. Eso hace que sea más fácil para un banco o empresa venir al Perú sin una inversión física tan grande. El tercer factor es una mayor apertura de la superintendencia para recibir con una visión positiva este tipo de solicitudes. Queremos que esto sume, y por eso trabajamos internamente para que los procesos de aprobación sean más ágiles, rápidos y eficientes.\n\n—¿Las entidades interesadas son extranjeras o locales?\n\nTodas son extranjeras, y hay un par de casos públicos. Uno es el banco BTG Pactual, de origen brasileño, que ha solicitado constituir un banco en el Perú y lo ha hecho público. El otro es Prex, una empresa del Cono Sur que opera en Uruguay, Argentina y Brasil, emisora de dinero electrónico que además quiere ofrecer préstamos sin captar ahorros. Esa es la que está más avanzada orque ellos presentaron la solicitud hace tiempo atrás y es probable que al tercer trimestre ya estén empezando a operar\n\n—Ya la SBS ha hecho un trabajo arduo con las cooperativas. ¿Está hoy el sistema totalmente saneado?\n\nHemos pasado claramente a una etapa distinta. No solo desde el desarrollo del sector, sino también desde la visión de la superintendencia. Se ha ajustado la regulación, que antes era básicamente una extensión de la financiera, hacia una más adecuada a la realidad del sistema cooperativo.\n\nEste sector tiene características muy valiosas: es inclusivo, incorpora a personas sin vínculo con otras entidades financieras y llega donde no llega nadie más. Además, promueve créditos grupales y a mujeres. Tiene muchos aspectos positivos y, por eso, es importante cuidarlo.\n\nEl problema fue que cuando la SBS comenzó esta supervisión, veníamos pues de muchos años en que no había existido supervisión y había un sector muy desordenado con muchas cosas que había que arreglar y eso es lo que se hizo en los primeros años.\n\nLa otra semana para reunirme con cooperativistas y escuchar cuáles son sus inquietudes, cómo ven ellos su situación, qué cosas es lo que les preocupa. Lo positivo es que hoy ya existe un fondo de seguro cooperativo. Invito a los cooperativistas a consultar la página web de la SBS, donde figura la lista de las cooperativas que han pagado sus contribuciones y están cubiertas. Ya se han dado un par de intervenciones donde el fondo pagó a los socios, lo que muestra que están mejor protegidos.\n\n—Ese fondo de seguro de depósito crecerá con el tiempo?\n\nEl fondo de seguro de cooperativas se parece en algunos aspectos al fondo de seguro de depósitos del sistema financiero, pero también tiene diferencias. Por ejemplo, su gobierno incluye representantes de las cooperativas, del Ministerio de la Producción y de la superintendencia. En cuanto a la cobertura, la ley establece un monto fijo de 5.000 o 10.000 soles, según el nivel de la cooperativa, a diferencia del fondo financiero que crece automáticamente por inflación cada año.\n\nSí, creo que faltó una precisión en la ley para establecer cómo se ajustaría. No estamos en la coyuntura de cuando se creó el fondo de seguro de depósito, donde había una inflación que justificaba ajustes permanentes, pero es un monto que, evidentemente, deberá actualizarse en algún momento.\n\n', '/uploads/news/scraped-e5cb61375ed7206af68a27b9e90a26d3.webp', 'https://larepublica.pe/economia/2025/11/05/superintendente-de-la-sbs-hasta-tres-competidores-han-mostrado-su-interes-de-ingresar-al-mercado-de-fondo-de-pensiones-hnews-218930', 'scraped', '2025-11-07 04:08:58', 1, 0, 3, NULL, '2025-11-07 04:08:58', '2025-11-07 04:08:58'),

Me parece muy negativo para ellos que no tengan esa apertura. Diera la impresión de que no conocen los temas, no dominan, no tienen planes ni propuestas.\n\nPUEDES VER: SBS: \"Hasta tres competidores han mostrado su interés de ingresar al mercado de fondo de pensiones\"\n\n— La encuesta de Ipsos mostrada en este CADE muestra que la delincuencia ha pasado a ser la principal preocupación de los empresarios, desplazando a la corrupción. ¿Cómo interpreta este cambio?\n\nEs claro el escenario. La gente está viviendo en carne propia y sufriendo mucho esta ola de delincuencia e inseguridad. La gente no puede emprender, está cerrando negocios, las extorsiones han crecido, se están asesinando cinco o seis personas por día en el país. Es dramático y terrible.\n\n—¿Cómo evalúa las acciones del presidente interino José Jerí?\n\nYo creo que ha dado un paso importante al asumir el liderazgo en la lucha contra la delincuencia y la inseguridad. Al declarar que él, como presidente de la República, asume ese liderazgo, ha dado un buen paso. Además, algunas medidas que se han tomado son interesantes. Es importante aglutinar a los otros poderes del Estado, porque este es un trabajo que deben hacer en conjunto el Ejecutivo, el Legislativo y el Judicial, sobre todo el Ministerio Público. Hay que unir a los tres poderes porque esta es una tarea ardua y que necesita del concurso de las máximas autoridades.\n\n— Como grupo empresarial más grande del país, ¿Qué expectativas tienen de cara al próximo año y a las elecciones?\n\nNosotros esperamos —y ese ha sido el mensaje en este CADE— que tenemos que involucrarnos más. Nuestras instituciones están deterioradas, nuestro Congreso está desprestigiado, pero eso no se soluciona poniéndose de costado, sino participando y apoyando a la gente de buena voluntad, comprobada y honesta, que quiera asumir retos.\n\n—En el plano económico, ¿qué medidas considera urgentes para reactivar la economía y sentar bases para el próximo año?\n\nHay que mantener la estabilidad macroeconómica. Nosotros tenemos un proceso de desinstitucionalización muy fuerte. Nuestras instituciones no dan confianza, nuestro sistema político tampoco da confianza, puesto que es impredecible y poco confiable. Lo único que nos queda son nuestros números macroeconómicos, nuestras cifras, que sí son vistas con buenos ojos por los inversionistas y en general en el entorno internacional. Entonces, si perdemos eso, lo perdemos todo. Es lo único que nos queda.\n\nHay que cuidar esa estabilidad y parte de eso es cuidar el déficit fiscal. Por eso hay que ponerle un freno inmediato a estos proyectos populistas que vienen del Congreso, porque van a deteriorar el único activo que tenemos.\n\n— Usted mencionó la importancia de cuidar el déficit fiscal para no poner en riesgo la estabilidad macroeconómica. En ese sentido, el Consejo Fiscal ha advertido sobre el impacto que podrían tener algunas leyes tributarias impulsadas desde el Congreso, como la reducción del IGV para restaurantes o peluquerías, o incluso la nueva ley agraria que ya se aprobó, ¿No cree que estos beneficios tributarios carecen de sustento?\n\nMire, yo soy de la idea de que en el Perú tenemos que tender a una reducción de la carga tributaria para los formales y buscar que mucha gente que hoy no tributa lo haga. Si tienes un buen estudio económico que demuestra que una reducción tributaria te permite generar más ingresos, esas medidas son saludables. Por ejemplo, a comienzos de este siglo exportábamos 500 millones de dólares en productos agrarios. Hoy exportamos 12.500 millones. Eso significa un salto gigante en la tributación. Aun bajando la tasa, hay una multiplicación importante. A eso deberíamos tender a que la producción se multiplique y eso va a multiplicar los ingresos del fisco. Hay que recordar que el sector agrario también ha sido castigado con el bono beta y algunas otras medidas que les han quitado competitividad.\n\n— ¿Y qué me dice respecto al estudio del equipo técnico del MEF —ojo no me refiero a la posición del exministro porque este decía otra cosa— que advertía que las reducciones tributarias, como la ley Chlimper 2.0 terminaban beneficiando principalmente a las grandes empresas?\n\nNo he tenido la oportunidad de leer ese estudio, pero sí te puedo decir que tenemos que estimular a que la economía crezca, a que los negocios crezcan. Es la única forma de desarrollarnos como país. Entre 2000 y 2013, el Perú crecía 5, 6 o 7%, y pudimos sacar al 35% de peruanos de la pobreza. Hay que seguir ese camino. Y si le damos las mayores facilitades al sector privado para que jale la locomotora del crecimiento y desarrollo. Hay que estar de acuerdo con esas medidas.\n\nY no nos olvidemos que el Estado ha crecido siete veces en 20 años: en 2003 el presupuesto público era 35 mil millones; hoy es 260 mil millones. Estoy seguro de que no se ha multiplicado por siete la calidad de los servicios. Hay que reducir la grasa del Estado y hacerlo más eficiente.\n\n— En materia de proyectos estratégicos, este mes se cumple un año de la puesta en marcha del megapuerto de Chancay, ya tenemos un hub, el nuevo aeropuerto internacional Jorge Chávez. En cuanto al primero, no se ha aprobado hasta la fecha el Plan de Desarrollo Urbano, por ejemplo. ¿En qué estamos fallando?\n\nEsa es una muestra clarísima de lo mal que funciona nuestro Estado. No es posible que tengamos un puerto de nivel mundial y que a su alrededor tengamos calles por las que no se puede ni circular. Tendríamos que haber hecho hace mucho tiempo la vía de evitamiento para llegar y salir del puerto en tiempos adecuados. Es decir, las inversiones privadas funcionan pero todo depende del planeamiento urbano y del Estado no funciona. Lo mismo ocurre con el aeropuerto Jorge Chávez y con el puerto del Callao.\n\n— No se aprobó el PDU por disputas entre el alcalde de Huaral y de Chancay, pero al final de cuentas, ¿Percibieron que faltó ese liderazgo de parte del gobierno de Dina Boluarte?\n\nSin duda. Si dos alcaldes no se pueden poner de acuerdo en resolver un tema tan importante, tiene que haber un liderazgo desde más arriba que los alinee. Faltó liderazgo.\n\n— Respecto al sueldo mínimo, entiendo que Confiep y la CGTP elevaron cartas al Ministerio de Trabajo para concretar el mecanismo técnico de la Remuneración Mínima Vital ¿Qué ha pasado, por qué no se han vuelto a reunir?\n\nHay que retomar. Esa es una mesa importantísima para que, de manera técnica y con un diálogo tripartito entre trabajadores, Estado y empleadores, consensuemos un mecanismo adecuado para la Remuneración Mínima Vital.\n\n— ¿Esto podría impulsarse durante el actual gobierno?\n\nSí, claro que sí. El gobierno de transición no significa que debamos cruzarnos de brazos y esperar al próximo gobierno para empezar a hacer cosas. Y eso el presidente Jerí lo ha entendido. En los mensajes que ha dado, ha dicho que este no es un gobierno inmóvil, a pesar de ser un gobierno de transición.\n\n— ¿Por qué tipo de candidato apostará el sector privado en las elecciones de 2026?\n\nBueno, hay libertad. No creo que todo el sector privado tenga un mismo perfil de candidato. Pero, si me haces una pregunta personal, yo creo que deberíamos apostar por un candidato con liderazgo, pero dialogante, no polarizante, que crea en la iniciativa privada, que entienda que el Estado está funcionando muy mal y hay que reformarlo absolutamente, que crea en la meritocracia y en llevar el Estado a las zonas donde no llega, pero con eficiencia, crea en la meritocracia del Estado, es lo que yo apostaría.\n\n— ¿Julio Velarde debería continuar? Porque más allá de la figura personal, está una institución meritocrática como el BCR. Y, si finalmente decide retirarse —como él mismo ha insinuado al señalar su cansancio para un nuevo periodo—, no habría mayor problema?\n\nYo creo que hay que agradecerle muchísimo por lo que ha hecho en los últimos 15 o 16 años al frente del BCR. Es una institución modelo. Si queremos el ejemplo de cómo funciona el Estado, no tenemos que irnos a otro país o a buscar en las bibliotecas, ahí está. Si él ya está pensando en su retiro, yo creo que la institucionalidad del BCR y los buenos economistas que hay en el país van a continuar con esa ruta.\n\n', '/uploads/news/scraped-079f8a980e1ea49c95ca6eaae461fa53.webp', 'https://larepublica.pe/economia/2025/11/06/confiep-sobre-el-sueldo-minimo-hay-que-retomar-en-este-gobierno-el-mecanismo-tecnico-para-definir-aumento-de-la-rmv-hnews-91170', 'scraped', '2025-11-07 04:09:00', 1, 0, 3, NULL, '2025-11-07 04:09:00', '2025-11-07 04:09:00'),

Según las primeras diligencias policiales, el cuerpo presentaba impactos de bala y, junto a ella, se encontró a un hombre, también asesinado, quien sería su expareja, según indicó su familia. La Policía investiga el caso como un presunto feminicidio seguido de suicidio.\n\nDe acuerdo con el testimonio del cuartelero del hospedaje, este acudió al cuarto tras escuchar una fuerte discusión y, poco después, varios disparos. Al ingresar, encontró ambos cuerpos, por lo que dio aviso inmediato a los agentes de la comisaría de El Progreso, quienes llegaron al lugar para iniciar las investigaciones correspondientes.\n\nPUEDES VER: Hallan muerta a joven enfermera de 19 años durante celebraciones de Halloween en Arequipa: Policía investiga presunto feminicidio\n\nLa afectada fue identificada como Flor de María Cerna Ramos, de 26 años, quien tenía un niño de 11 años, el cual queda en estado de orfandad tras el asesinato de su madre. Según sus familiares, el presunto feminicida fue Walter Manuel Águila Guardamino, de aproximadamente 50 años, quien habría acosado a la joven tras el fin de su relación sentimental. De acuerdo a lo que indican, buscaron denunciar amenazas en el mes de septiembre, en la comisaría de El Progreso, pero la Policía no las recibió. Estas amenazas también se habrían extendido hasta su pareja actual. La hipótesis que maneja la familia de la víctima es que el sujeto le disparó a Flor de María antes de quitarse la vida.\n\nLas autoridades policiales llegaron al lugar para recabar evidencias, tomar declaraciones y realizar las pericias necesarias para esclarecer las circunstancias exactas del hecho, luego de que Serenazgo acordonara la zona. Según indicaron los oficiales, el encargado refirió que la pareja ingresó al establecimiento al rededor de las 7:10 p.m. en un vehículo.\n\nTras el suceso, la Municipalidad de Carabayllo terminó por clausurar el establecimiento debido a faltas administrativas.\n\nPUEDES VER: Gobierno peruano autoriza extradición de Jossimar Cabrera hacia los Estados Unidos por feminicidio de Sheylla Gutiérrez\n\nSegún se pudo conocer, Flor de María se desempeñaba como mototaxista para solventar sus gastos y los de su menor hijo.

Fuentes cercanas afirman que el padre del menor no enviaba dinero desde hacía 11 meses.\n\nInvestigaciones preliminares arrojan que la noche del crimen, Flor salió de su domicilio con dirección al gimnasio, como usualmente lo hacía. Sin embargo, no regresó. Al parecer, habría sido llevada con engaños por su ex pareja hasta el sindicado lugar, ubicado en la Asociación Las Dalias.\n\nAhora, sus restos serán velados la tarde del jueves 6 de noviembre, en Carabayllo.

Last week, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, and Amazon reported their 2025 capital expenditures would total roughly $370 billion, an', 'The amount of capital pouring into AI data center projects is staggering. Last week, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, and Amazon reported their 2025 capital expenditures would total roughly $370 billion, and they expect that number to keep rising in 2026. The biggest spender last quarter was Microsoft, which put nearly $35 billion into data centers and other investments, equivalent to 45 percent of its revenue.\n\nRarely, if ever, has a single technology absorbed this much money this quickly. Warnings of an AI bubble are getting louder every day, but whether or not a crash eventually happens, the frenzy is already reshaping the US economy. Harvard economist Jason Furman estimates that investment in data centers and software processing technology accounted for nearly all of US GDP growth in the first half of 2025.\n\nToday, we’re looking at how data centers are impacting three crucial areas: public markets, jobs, and energy.\n\nThe US stock market is booming, mostly thanks to AI. Since ChatGPT launched in November 2022, AI-related stocks have accounted for 75 percent of S&P 500 returns and 80 percent of earnings growth, according to JPMorgan’s Michael Cembalest. The question now is whether that growth will be sustainable as tech firms continue spending heavily on AI infrastructure.\n\nAt the start of this year, tech giants were financing their AI projects mostly with cash they had on hand. As financial journalist Derek Thompson pointed out, the ten largest US public companies kicked off 2025 with historically high free cash flow margins. In other words, their businesses were so profitable that they had billions of dollars sitting around to put towards Nvidia GPUs and data center buildouts.\n\nThat trend has largely continued through 2025. Alphabet, for example, told investors last week that its capital expenditures this year would be as much as $93 billion, an increase from its previous estimate of $75 billion. But it also reported that revenue was up 33 percent year over year. Put another way, Silicon Valley is both spending more and earning more. That means everything is fine, right?\n\nNot exactly. For one thing, tech giants appear to be using accounting tricks to make their financials look rosier than they may really be in reality. A significant portion of AI investment flows to Nvidia, which releases new versions of its GPUs approximately every two years. But companies like Microsoft and Alphabet are currently estimating that their chips will last six years. If they need to upgrade sooner to stay competitive—a likely possibility—that could wind up eating into their profits and weaken their overall performance.\n\nSome tech companies have spent so much on AI recently that they have been forced to look for new sources of funding. One noteworthy example is Meta, which recently announced a $27 billion deal to develop a cluster of data centers in Louisiana. The project was created through a special purpose vehicle (SPV), an increasingly common organizational structure that allows firms to avoid putting large amounts of debt on their balance sheets. Last week, Meta said it also raised another $30 billion in debt through a more conventional channel: selling corporate bonds.\n\nA single data center may house tens of thousands of GPUs that can collectively perform trillions of operations in the course of an AI training run. That massive computing power generates intense heat, and the hardware needs to be cooled to keep running safely. As the race to build AI infrastructure accelerates, it’s placing intense pressure on the US energy grid.\n\nPart of the problem is that the US simply isn’t building enough grid capacity to support all of the data centers currently being built. “I think it is very likely we will see a lot of these facilities constructed with computing equipment in place but there won’t be electrons to power these facilities, because the fuel resources aren’t in place,” says Zachary Krause, an energy analyst at East Daley Analytics who has studied the data center industry.\n\nBecause supply can’t keep pace with demand, energy prices are rising, especially in communities near data centers. In the first half of 2025, American utilities sought nearly $30 billion in rate increases, according to The New Yorker.\n\nLast year, the US deployed 49 GW of renewable energy infrastructure, according to the American Clean Power Association. China, meanwhile, added 429 GW. The Chinese government is also reportedly offering generous energy subsidies to domestic tech giants like ByteDance and Alibaba to help keep their energy costs down.\n\nIn a letter sent to the White House last week, OpenAI warned that “limits on how much electricity the US can generate to power AI development” are threatening the country’s ability to maintain its global lead in artificial intelligence.\n\nThe data center boom is coinciding with a softening labor market. Private employers in the US added just 42,000 jobs in October, mostly in education and healthcare, according to the payroll processor ADP. Big tech companies, however, have been shedding workers, even as they report record profits. Amazon announced last week that it would eliminate 14,000 corporate roles and more cuts are expected soon. Microsoft, meanwhile, laid off about 15,000 people during two rounds of cuts in May and July.\n\nWhile it’s easy to look at these trends and assume that AI is leading to widespread job loss, the story isn’t quite so simple. There’s some evidence that generative AI is eliminating entry-level roles in certain industries, like software engineering. Many companies are also eager to find ways to automate tasks that humans currently do. Amazon, for example, estimated that it could avoid hiring 160,000 people in the US by 2027 by relying on robots, according to internal documents reviewed by The New York Times.\n\nBut at least right now, the main factor impacting jobs isn’t necessarily AI itself, but the data centers powering it. Big companies and investors have a limited amount of capital to spend each year, and they’re putting the majority of it toward building data centers. That means less investment is flowing to other sectors like manufacturing, which lost 3,000 jobs last month according to ADP.\n\nThis is an edition of the Model Behavior newsletter.

Creía que entonces terminaría de pagar los brutales crímenes que había perpetrado junto con Alberto Fujimori durante una década de gobierno. Pero Vladimiro Montesinos Torres recién dejará la cárcel el jueves 21 de agosto de 2031. Se quedará encerrado cinco años más de lo que se pensaba. Tres meses después de celebrar 86 años de edad (el 20 de mayo).\n\nDebe responder por el secuestro, tortura y homicidio de Santiago Gómez Palomino, de 27 años, un evangélico de la Misión Israelita del Nuevo Pacto Universal, falsamente acusado de terrorista por el Destacamento Colina. Esta organización criminal compuesta por agentes del Servicio de Inteligencia del Ejército (SIE), operó bajo el patrocinio y las órdenes de Fujimori y Montesinos entre 1991 y 1992, aplicando una estrategia basada en el asesinato selectivo de presuntos miembros de Sendero Luminoso. Santiago Gómez Palomino fue la víctima número 55 de la banda de militares fujimoristas.\n\nEs el menos conocido de los asesinados por el Destacamento Colina porque durante mucho tiempo Gómez estuvo en condición de desaparecido. En la madrugada del 9 de julio de 1992 fue secuestrado por un grupo encabezado por el mayor EP Santiago Martin Rivas. Lo condujeron hasta la playa La Chira, en Chorrillos, no muy lejos de donde vivía con su pareja en estado de gestación, en el asentamiento humano San Genaro, en el mismo distrito. Querían que confesara dónde ocultaba el armamento de una célula senderista. No era verdad. Para que no quedara en evidencia la incompetencia del grupo militar que actuaba bajo autorización de Fujimori y Montesinos, mataron con tiros en la cabeza a Santiago Gómez Palomino, quien hasta el último suspiro negó ser terrorista debido a su confesión evangélica israelita. No les importó.\n\nEl silencio cómplice duró hasta el jueves 6 de diciembre de 2001 cuando uno de los criminales se acogió a la colaboración eficaz y lo contó todo, incluyendo la ubicación de la tumba clandestina. La información permitió que la madre de Gómez, Victoria Palomino Buitrón, y su hermana, María Gómez Palomino, iniciaran las acciones legales para recuperar los restos y castigar a los responsables. El cargo lo asumió la abogada Gloria Cano Legua, de la Asociación Pro Derechos Humanos (Aprodeh), logrando la sentencia condenatoria.\n\nVíctima. Más de 20 años estuvo oculto el cuerpo de Santiago Gómez Palomino en la playa La Chira. Lo acusaron sin pruebas de terrorista. Foto: La República\n\nPUEDES VER: Vladimiro Montesinos estará preso hasta el 2032: nueva sentencia de 6 años alarga su condena\n\nEl viernes 25 de mayo de 2012, casi 20 años después del homicidio, y luego de varios intentos, la fiscalía encontró lo que quedaba del cuerpo de Santiago Gómez Palomino. El suboficial FAP (r) Julio Yataco Lavalle aceptó haber proporcionado a los criminales la información sobre Gómez y de haberlos guiado hasta la casa de quien llamaban “El evangelista”. El testigo dijo que obligaron a Gómez a cavar su propia tumba y Santiago Martin ordenó eliminarlo. Los forenses confirmaron que los restos pertenecían al evangélico israelita desaparecido, y que había recibido balazos mortales en la cabeza, de arriba hacia abajo. Lo habían obligado a arrodillarse.\n\nLa ejecución de Santiago Gómez Palomino se produjo entre el asesinato del periodista Pedro Yauri Bustamante y seis miembros de la familia Ventocilla, en el Norte Chico, el 24 de junio de 1992, y la matanza de La Cantuta, el 18 de julio del mismo año. Los homicidios del Destacamento Colina no hicieron ningún daño a Sendero Luminoso simplemente porque las víctimas no eran terroristas. Pero Santiago Martin y sus secuaces necesitaban presentar resultados a sus superiores del Ejército y del gobierno de Fujimori y Montesinos. Asesinaron a Santiago Gómez Palomino y lo reportaron como un terrorista en cuya vivienda se reunían los miembros de un “comando de aniquilamiento” que actuaba en el sur de Lima y que guardaba el armamento y dinamita en la misma vivienda. Todo era completamente falso.\n\nEl 18 de diciembre de 2017 se dictó la primera sentencia para Vladimiro Montesinos y sus cómplices: 20 años de prisión por desaparición forzada y homicidio calificado. Desaparición forzada es un delito de lesa humanidad que no prescribe. El exasesor peleó hasta la Corte Suprema arguyendo que ya había cumplido los 20 años por la ejecución de Santiago Gómez Palomino, porque el 24 de junio de 2026 completaba los 25 años por la matanza de La Cantuta. Pero el colegiado rechazó la nulidad que interpuso y precisó: “La pena privativa de la libertad del imputado Vladimiro Montesinos Torres vencerá el 21 de agosto de 2031”. La decisión fue tomada por la Sala Penal Transitoria de la Corte Suprema, el ocho de julio de 2021.\n\nEn la resolución judicial se destaca que varios exintegrantes del Destacamento Colina, además de la confesión de Julio Yataco Lavalle, aceptaron haber participado en el crimen de Santiago Gómez Palomino.\n\nJosé Alarcón Gonzáles y Héctor Gamarra Mamani declararon que el día del asesinato, el 9 de julio de 1992, les avisaron para reunirse en “La Ferretería”, la casa del agente Nelson Carbajal García, donde el Destacamento Colina tenía a disposición un arsenal. En lugar encontraron a Santiago Martin Rivas y Carlos Pichilingüe Guevara, donde recibieron instrucciones sobre el operativo para detener a Santiago Gómez Palomino, “El evangelista”. Los agentes Hugo Coral Goycochea, Jorge Ortíz Mantas, Ángel Sauñi Pomaya y Julio Chuqui Aguirre, entre otros, corroboraron los hechos en el proceso judicial.\n\nConfesión. El suboficial en retiro FAP Julio Yataco Lavalle reconoció que condujo a los agentes del Destacamento Colina a la vivienda de Santiago Gómez Palomino. Foto: La República\n\nPUEDES VER: Relevo del Comandante General de la FAP no cambiará calendario de compra de 24 cazas\n\nDespués de 159 sesiones de audiencia, se determinó judicialmente que Santiago Martin y Carlos Pichilingüe no actuaron por su cuenta sino por mandato de sus jefes cuando decidieron secuestrar, torturar y quitarle la vida a Santiago Gómez Palomino.\n\nDice la sentencia: “La afirmación de que los procesados Martin Rivas y Pichilingüe Guevara formaron parte del Destacamento de inteligencia Colina, y recibieron órdenes superiores para la ejecución de un plan debidamente concertado, así como haber ordenado a los agentes de inteligencia la vigilancia e incursión en el domicilio de Gómez Palomino, se encuentra sustentada en la prueba actuada en el plenario, que da cuenta que desde el momento en el que el acusado (general EP Juan Rivero Lazo se hizo cargo de la DINTE (Dirección de Inteligencia del Ejército, en 1991), tuvo directa coordinación con los también coacusado (el jefe nominal del Servicio Nacional de Inteligencia, SIN, general EP Julio Salazar Monroe y (el asesor presidencial) Vladimiro Montesinos, para llevar a cabo coordinaciones de inteligencia”.\n\nPor lo que se determinó que Vladimiro Montesinos, y sus cómplices, Juan Rivero Lazo, Santiago Martin Rivas y Carlos Pichilingüe Guevara completarían la sanción de 20 años de carcelería por el homicidio de Santiago Gómez Palomino, el 21 de agosto de 2031. Pero no son los únicos. Los ejecutores recibieron otras penas.\n\nEn las redes sociales circulan versiones falsas sobre la próxima excarcelación de Vladimiro Montesinos, ignorando alevemente que cuenta con una sentencia condenatoria que prolongará cinco años más su estadía en la Base Naval del Callao.\n\nIncluso el exasesor de Fujimori es presentado casi como un “héroe” de la lucha contra el terrorismo, cuando lo cierto es que el fallo de la Corte Suprema evidencia que su estrategia de eliminación selectiva de presuntos senderistas fue un completo fracaso. Los 55 asesinatos extrajudiciales, entre cuyas víctimas de encuentra Santiago Gómez Palomino, prueban que nunca funcionaron sus “planes de inteligencia”. Y que por eso pagará prisión hasta el jueves 21 de agosto de 2031.\n\nLa decisión de la Corte Suprema sobre la duración de la prisión de Vladimiro Montesinos y sus cómplices, entre ellos Juan Rivero Lazo.

Sin embargo, el registro de votaciones del Congreso muestra que su agrupación apoyó medidas que benefician a la minería no formal, mientras se registran al menos tres personas pertenecientes a este sector en las filas de su partido.\n\nPUEDES VER: Trenes Caltrain están en mal estado en el Parque La Muralla y gestión de López Aliaga se victimiza\n\nLas declaraciones de López Aliaga en el CADE 2025 reflejan su estrategia de campaña: presentarse como un político antisistema mientras su partido reproduce las mismas prácticas que dice combatir.

El propio López Aliaga no se pronunció en ese momento en contra de la reforma, lo que muestra una doble postura frente a un tema clave de gobernabilidad. Su promesa de ahora contrasta con la conducta previa de su agrupación.\n\nAdemás, durante su exposición en la CADE, el alcalde capitalino anunció que reduciría el salario de los parlamentarios: “El sueldo del congresista será el promedio de su sueldo en los últimos cinco años”, dijo. La frase buscó reforzar su imagen de austeridad, aunque en la práctica su partido ha defendido mayores beneficios y presupuestos para el Legislativo.\n\nPUEDES VER: Fernán Altuve arremete contra López Aliaga: “Su tendencia hacia la extrema derecha es preocupante”\n\nEn la misma cita empresarial, Rafael López Aliaga negó cualquier vínculo de su partido con la minería informal, afirmando con tono desafiante: “Te pago cien mil dólares por cada uno que tú me demuestres”. Sin embargo, según Infobae Perú, la bancada de Renovación Popular votó a favor de la ampliación del Registro Integral de Formalización Minera (REINFO), una medida criticada por facilitar la actividad de mineros informales y proteger operaciones fuera del marco legal.\n\nEl caso más representativo es el de Máximo Béquer, presidente de Confederación Nacional de Pequeña Minería y Minería Artesanal del Perú (Confemin), un empresario minero que fue vinculado a Renovación Popular y luego se apartó tras cuestionamientos por su relación con la minería no formal. Aunque el partido intentó desvincularse, el episodio evidencia la cercanía de algunos integrantes con ese sector económico. Según el Registro de Organizaciones Políticas (ROP), actualmente se encuentran inscritos Magno Palomino Garamendi, Javier Bernal Salas y Rossbel Anyosa Pariona, también integrantes de Confemin.\n\nLas declaraciones de López Aliaga son, por tanto, inconsistentes con la actuación legislativa de su bancada. Mientras niega nexos con la minería ilegal en los foros públicos, en el Parlamento su partido ha apoyado iniciativas que benefician a los mineros informales.', '/uploads/news/scraped-2be6d602d615a46db1fa75c8b7c7338b.webp', 'https://larepublica.pe/politica/2025/11/06/rafael-lopez-aliaga-en-el-cade-sus-mentiras-sobre-bicameralidad-y-mineros-informales-en-renovacion-popular-hnews-551568', 'scraped', '2025-11-07 15:00:56', 1, 0, 5, NULL, '2025-11-07 15:00:56', '2025-11-07 15:00:56'),

Después de haber recogido los aportes de diversos funcionarios de ministerios, el grupo de trabajo que preside el congresista Víctor Cutipa pondrá a discusión una nueva fórmula legislativa que amplía el Reinfo hasta fines del 2027 o hasta que entre en vigencia la postergada Ley Mape.\n\nAnte este escenario, La República conversó con Julia Torreblanca, presidenta de la Sociedad Nacional de Minería, Petróleo y Energía (SNMPE), quien también se sumó a las voces que instan al Ejecutivo a definir una postura sobre el destino del proceso de formalización minera. En su opinión, se necesitan propuestas tangibles para mejorar el predictamen.\n\nPUEDES VER: “Para México, el comercio con Perú es muy marginal, pero la ruptura diplomática es histórica”, afirma experta mexicana\n\n\"Nosotros también reclamamos la ausencia del Ejecutivo en esta mesa de trabajo y esperamos que se integren pronto, pero con propuestas tangibles para mejorar el texto. No hay forma de que estas 50.000 personas o empresas que fueron retiradas del Reinfo se reincorporen\", declaró a este medio en el marco del CADE Ejecutivos 2025.\n\nRespecto al planteamiento de la Comisión de Energía y Minas de extender la vigencia del Reinfo, Torreblanca consideró que dicha medida no es viable e hizo un llamado a las autoridades a cerrar este registro. En su lugar, indicó que la propuesta de dictamen debe considerar normas de seguridad y salud para el trabajador minero, mecanismos de trazabilidad de los minerales, cumplimiento de normas ambientales, entre otros aspectos.\n\nFinalmente, reflexionó que, además de asegurar la estabilidad económica, luchar contra la inseguridad y garantizar un proceso de transición hacia el nuevo gobierno, el Poder Ejecutivo debería poner su foco de atención en el combate a la minería ilegal y una posible ampliación del proceso de formalización minera.\n\n\"Estamos invocando a los candidatos y a los partidos políticos que van a formar parte o están postulando a las elecciones a que nos confirmen que sus campaña no están siendo financiadas por la minería ilegal u otras economías ilícitas. Esperamos suscribir pronto un pacto por la gobernabilidad y la transparencia (...) Invocamos también al gobierno a tomar una posición firme y a que no permita una extensión del Reinfo una vez más\", agregó.\n\nPUEDES VER: Gobierno no define postura sobre Reinfo, mientras Congreso reclama presencia del Ejecutivo en mesa de trabajo\n\nComo informó el Instituto Peruano de Economía (IPE), las exportaciones de la minería ilegal vinculada al oro estarían por igualar a los despachos formales, e incluso podrían superarlos si es que no se implementan medidas de control. Para este año, la entidad estima que los envíos del metal dorado ilegal alcanzarían entre 105 y 115 toneladas, con un valor que bordearía los US$12.000 millones.\n\nDe acuerdo con Julia Torreblanca, el dinero que deja de percibir el país por esta actividad ilícita impacta en todos los peruanos, ya que significan \"menos carreteras, escuelas y puentes\". En esa línea, fue enfática en señalar que la minería ilegal no paga impuestos, no provee de trabajo formal, ni cuida la salud de los trabajadores ni respeta nuestro ambiente.\n\nPUEDES VER: Nueva ampliación del Reinfo minero en pausa: Congreso aprueba crear mesa técnica para continuar el debate\n\n\"El lunes estuvimos en el Ministerio de Economía con el presidente Jerí y algo que le hemos pedido es que nos hagan saber cuál es su posición respecto a la minería ilegal, teniendo en cuenta que estamos en un contexto electoral. La minería formal ha contribuido en los últimos años con el 14% del PBI. Entonces, es preocupante lo que explica el IPE respecto a que la exportación de oro ilegal equipararía o sobrepasaría a la exportación de oro formal.

El inmueble era habitado por un adulto mayor, cuya mascota, una perrita, perdió la vida durante el siniestro.\n\nDe acuerdo con el Cuerpo General de Bomberos Voluntarios del Perú, al lugar acudieron cinco unidades motobomba, una ambulancia y una unidad de rescate ligero para controlar las llamas y evitar que el fuego se propague a las viviendas aledañas. Sin embargo, los bomberos enfrentaron serias dificultades para sofocar el incendio debido a la falta de agua en la zona.\n\nPUEDES VER: Vecinos de Pueblo Libre alertan segundo forado en menos de dos días y genera caos vehicular en av.

Es una tremenda negligencia, podría haber gente muriéndose y no hay agua”, declaró a La República.\n\nSegún las hipótesis preliminares de los vecinos que alertaron a las autoridades, el incendio se registró aproximadamente a las 7:00 p.m. Señalaron que el adulto mayor no contaba con servicio eléctrico y solía utilizar velas, lo que podría haber provocado el fuego. Sin embargo, algunos testigos aseguraron que las llamas se iniciaron desde el exterior de la vivienda, por lo que no se descarta que el siniestro haya sido provocado.\n\nEl propietario no se encontraba en el domicilio al momento del incendio. Los vecinos dieron aviso inmediato a los bomberos, mientras que una sobrina del afectado llegó poco después. Hasta el cierre de esta nota, los rescatistas continuaban trabajando en el enfriamiento del inmueble y en la evaluación de los daños materiales ocasionados.\n\nPUEDES VER: Madre de ‘Maldito Cris’ afirma que el coronel Víctor Revoredo le ofrecía dinero a cambio de información sobre Wanda del Valle\n\n¡Sigue a La República en WhatsApp!

La decisión se basa en la presunta participación de ambos en el intento de golpe de Estado el pasado 7 de diciembre de 2022.\n\nEl informe destaca que Betssy Chávez participó activamente en los hechos ocurridos el 7 de diciembre de 2022, cuando Pedro Castillo anunció la disolución del Congreso y la instauración de un “Gobierno de excepción”. Según el documento, Chávez habría guiado a un equipo de TV Perú hasta el despacho presidencial para grabar el mensaje a la nación, se mantuvo en Palacio de Gobierno antes y después de su emisión, y no expresó rechazo alguno frente al intento de golpe de Estado, renunciando horas después.\n\n\"El día 7 de diciembre de 2022, guio al equipo de TV Perú compuesto por la señorita Cintya Isabel Malpartida Guarniz y Antonio Pantoja Ochoa, desde el interior de la PCM al despacho presidencial en Palacio de Gobierno.

En el caso del exmandatario, la sanción le impediría postular a un cargo en el eventual Senado o Cámara de Diputados, posibilidad que había mencionado durante las audiencias de su juicio oral. Por su parte, Chávez perdería toda opción de aspirar a la Presidencia de la República, un objetivo que ella misma manifestó en una entrevista, lo que dejaría sin efecto cualquier intento de retorno a la política activa.\n\nPUEDES VER: Pedro Castillo: Fiscalía se ratifica y pide 34 años para expresidente y 25 años para Betssy Chávez por caso golpe de Estado\n\nDurante la sesión de la Subcomisión de Acusaciones, las intervenciones de los congresistas reflejaron la polarización del proceso. La congresista Martha Moyano defendió la vacancia de Pedro Castillo, argumentando que se trató de un “delito de flagrancia” y que no era necesario alcanzar los 104 votos reglamentarios.\n\nPor su parte, el congresista Pasión Dávila cuestionó la propuesta de inhabilitación, señalando que hasta el momento no se ha probado que el expresidente haya cometido algún delito, y sostuvo que la sanción carece de sustento jurídico. \"Si nosotros hacemos un análisis del proceso judicial contra el presidente Pedro Castillo, no encuentran en ningún parte de la acusación un delito que él haya cometido\", mencionó.\n\nEl congresista Jaime Quito criticó el proceso, calificándolo como una persecución política. Afirmó que, pese a que no se logró demostrar rebelión ni conspiración, el Congreso ya había definido la sanción contra Betssy Chávez y Pedro Castillo, y advirtió que este hecho marcará negativamente la historia del Parlamento.\n\nPUEDES VER: Castillo en juicio por caso golpe de Estado: “Vamos a llegar a 80 sesiones sin que el fiscal me diga dónde están las armas”\n\nEl informe aprobado por la Subcomisión de Acusaciones detalla que Betssy Chávez incurrió en conductas que respaldaron las decisiones presidenciales del 7 de diciembre, incluyendo la coordinación de medios y la instrucción para el ingreso de manifestantes a la Plaza Mayor de Lima, entre otros actos.\n\nEn la misma línea, se señala que Pedro Castillo instruyó a funcionarios y a la Policía Nacional para ejecutar medidas que vulneraban la Constitución, con el respaldo de ministros como Willy Huerta, quien facilitó el cumplimiento de órdenes presidenciales.\n\nLa Subcomisión concluye que ambos funcionarios infringieron múltiples artículos de la Constitución Política del Perú, por lo que propone la inhabilitación por diez años. Este dictamen se remite a la Comisión Permanente del Congreso para su debate y aprobación final, mientras que la denuncia contra Roberto Sánchez Palomino queda archivada.\n\nPUEDES VER: Petro sobre Perú tras declarar persona non grata a Sheinbaum por asilo a Betssy Chávez: \"Va contra la Convención Americana\"\n\nCon 10 votos a favor, 3 en contra y ninguna abstención, la SAC aprobó el informe final que recomienda la inhabilitación por 10 años de Betssy Chávez y Pedro Castillo.

El objetivo es cumplir la regla fiscal vigente tras dos años consecutivos de incumplimiento, cuestionado por expertos y organismos como el Consejo Fiscal.\n\nEl déficit fiscal anualizado, es decir, la brecha que se produce cuando el Estado gasta más de lo que recauda, alcanzó a octubre de 2025 el 2,4% del producto bruto interno (PBI), superando el límite de 2,2% que se debe cumplir este año. Ante este desbalance, el Poder Ejecutivo argumenta que los ingresos tributarios han sido menores a lo proyectado, mientras el gasto público continúa creciendo, sobre todo por mayores devoluciones tributarias.\n\nPUEDES VER: Confiep: \"Hay que retomar el mecanismo técnico que define el aumento del sueldo mínimo\"\n\n\"El cumplimiento de la meta fiscal requiere una reducción sostenida del déficit, una mejor evolución de los ingresos y una moderación del gasto\", señala el documento, refrendado por la ministra de Economía y Finanzas, Denisse Miralles.\n\nEl decreto dispone que todas las transferencias financieras del Poder Ejecutivo —autorizadas por la Ley de Presupuesto 2025 o por otras normas— solo podrán aprobarse hasta siete días después de publicada la norma. Pasado ese plazo, ningún ministerio ni entidad dependiente del Gobierno podrá realizar nuevas transferencias, bajo responsabilidad del titular del pliego.\n\nPUEDES VER: Retiro AFP: El 34% de hogares peruanos usará este dinero extra para pagar deudas\n\nSe exceptúan únicamente las transferencias a la Caja de Pensiones Militar Policial, las efectuadas en el marco del programa Llamkasun a favor de gobiernos locales y las que realiza el Seguro Integral de Salud (SIS).\n\nAsimismo, se prohíbe comprometer gastos en conceptos considerados no prioritarios, como servicios de publicidad, consultorías externas, talleres, impresiones, organización de eventos y nuevas contrataciones bajo el régimen CAS. Con ello, el Gobierno busca reducir el gasto corriente en rubros que suelen incrementarse hacia fin de año.\n\nOtro de los puntos centrales del decreto es la restricción al gasto de capital. Los pliegos del Poder Ejecutivo no podrán habilitar presupuesto para proyectos de inversión que no estén en ejecución física o que no tengan contratos firmados. Solo se podrán financiar obras o componentes ya avanzados o comprometidos legalmente.\n\nEsto significa que no se iniciarán nuevos proyectos durante lo que resta del año fiscal, salvo aquellos con contrato vigente, lo que podría ralentizar la ejecución pública, especialmente en regiones.\n\nEl documento también faculta al Ministerio de Economía y Finanzas (MEF) a reorientar los recursos liberados por la aplicación de estas medidas hacia la Reserva de Contingencia, fondo destinado a atender emergencias o gastos imprevistos. Estas reasignaciones se aprobarán mediante decreto supremo refrendado por el MEF.\n\nSin embargo, la Dirección General de Presupuesto Público podrá establecer excepciones cuando sea necesario garantizar la continuidad de los servicios esenciales del Estado. Las medidas estarán vigentes hasta el 31 de diciembre de 2025, y los ministros o titulares de los pliegos serán responsables de su cumplimiento.\n\nLa ministra Miralles había adelantado la aprobación de este decreto durante su presentación en CADE Ejecutivos 2025, como una señal de disciplina fiscal ante los mercados y el Congreso, luego de varios meses en que el gasto público superó las previsiones iniciales. En esa ocasión, indicó que el ajuste permitiría canalizar alrededor de S/1.200 millones hacia sectores prioritarios, principalmente seguridad ciudadana, salud y servicios esenciales.\n\nEn diálogo con La República, el economista e investigador Armando Mendoza señaló que este decreto \"en lo coyuntural puede tener sentido, pero en lo estructural no es una solución\". A su juicio, responde a \"una lógica cortoplacista, como un parche para tratar de cuadrar el 2025 y que el que venga en 2026 vea cómo hace con el presupuesto donde hay una pugna\". \"Están controlando la pelota para pasársela al siguiente\", agregó.\n\nMendoza advirtió que, aunque el gasto estatal tiene problemas, también genera demanda. \"La austeridad puede cuadrar los números, pero va a tener un costo económico y social. Entiendo que la lógica es tratar de llegar como sea, forzando a esa meta idílica del 2,2%\", apuntó. \"Todas las proyecciones apuntan que el 2026 volveremos a incumplir la regla fiscal. Se analiza desde una mentalidad de cuadrar el 2025, que es mi responsabilidad y el próximo año en julio me voy\", comentó.\n\nEn la misma línea, Cynthia Velezmoro, abogada y experta en planificación fiscal, consideró que “cumplir la meta fiscal es importante, pero no basta con recortes o centralización”. \"La sostenibilidad exige saber cómo se ahorra, qué resultados se obtienen y quién evalúa la eficiencia del gasto\", remarcó.\n\n\"El país necesita algo más, liderazgo para transformar la disciplina contable en gobernanza fiscal. Es momento de mirar la política fiscal no solo como contabilidad, sino como una estrategia de desarrollo y credibilidad internacional\", analizó.\n\nMendoza añadió que el debate actual se concentra solo en el recorte de gastos, sin atender el lado de los ingresos. \"El déficit se cierra deduciendo gastos o aumentando ingresos, pero aquí solo están haciendo la mitad. Una medida efectiva sería una reforma tributaria para incrementar la recaudación\", sostuvo.\n\nRecordó además que el Perú tiene una presión tributaria de apenas 14%, por debajo del promedio latinoamericano (21%) y muy lejos del nivel de los países desarrollados (34%).\"En la historia no existe país que haya alcanzado desarrollo con una presión tributaria del 14% o 15%.

Del total de créditos, S/28.361 millones están dirigidos a mypes, lo que consolida su rol clave en la inclusión financiera y el desarrollo económico regional.\n\nEl proyecto de ley N° 11422/2024-CR, denominado “Ley que fortalece a las Cajas Municipales y les da mayor competitividad”, fue presentado el 4 de junio de 2025 y cuenta con dictamen favorable de la Comisión de Economía desde el 10 de julio de 2025. Su debate en el Pleno está pendiente desde el 19 de agosto.\n\nPUEDES VER: Más de 250 agencias de cajas municipales en riesgo de cierre por la extorsión, denuncia gremio\n\nSegún Reaño, estas medidas son esenciales para mantener la capacidad de las cajas de competir con la banca privada. Además, aseguró, necesitan poder contratar personal o adquirir servicios en campañas de alta demanda sin las rigideces del aparato estatal.\n\nPUEDES VER: Cajas municipales triplican ganancias y superan los S/398 millones: ¿Qué entidad financiera dio el salto?\n\nLa FEPCMAC advirtió sobre los riesgos del proyecto de ley N° 5514/2022-CR (y su correlativo 5620/2022-CR), aprobado en primera votación en el Pleno el 9 de julio de 2025. Este propone modificar la conformación de los directorios de las cajas municipales, incluyendo como entidad designante a la Confederación Nacional de Comerciantes (CONACO), así como permitir que exintegrantes de comisiones congresales integren dichos directorios.\n\nPara la FEPCMAC, la medida representa un retroceso en el gobierno corporativo del sistema, al introducir posibles injerencias políticas y restar independencia a las Unidades de Auditoría Interna (UAI).\n\nY es que durante cuatro décadas las cajas se han gobernado bajo criterios técnicos supervisados por la SBS, sin interferencia política. Alterar esa estructura pondría en riesgo la confianza de los inversionistas estratégicos que hoy negocian su ingreso al sistema.\n\n\"No ha habido una intervención de parte del Estado ni de los municipios en esta conformación del directorio\", reafirmó Reaño.\n\nEl gremio recordó que la SBS y la Secretaría de Integridad Pública han expresado opiniones desfavorables sobre esta iniciativa, por considerar que afectaría la estabilidad institucional y la confianza en el sistema financiero descentralizado.\n\nMartín Zanabria y Rolando Reaño Vidal, representantes de FEPMAC en la Comisión de Economía\n\nLa FEPCMAC también cuestionó el proyecto de ley N° 9503/2024-CR, que busca condonar deudas a pequeños agricultores de Piura afectados por la crisis hídrica, cargando los costos a las propias entidades financieras.\n\nEn ese sentido, la interpretación es que el proyecto es confiscatorio y pone en riesgo los depósitos del público. Las cajas no pueden condonar créditos sin respaldo del Estado, porque operan con los ahorros de millones de peruanos.\n\nTanto la SBS como el MEF emitieron opiniones desfavorables a esta propuesta, por considerar que afecta la sostenibilidad y solvencia del sistema financiero nacional.\n\nReaño mencionó también el proyecto de ley N° 12912/2025-CR, que modifica la Ley General del Sistema Financiero (Ley N° 26702). La propuesta busca ajustar las causales de impedimento para ser organizador o gerente de una entidad financiera, estableciendo que solo se apliquen sanciones cuando exista responsabilidad penal, civil o administrativa comprobada.\n\nAsimismo, destacó el proyecto N° 12852/2025-SBS, presentado por la propia Superintendencia de Banca y Seguros, que propone modificar el Decreto Supremo N° 157-90-EF, norma que regula a las cajas municipales.\n\nEsta iniciativa busca modernizar la estructura de los directorios, mejorar la gobernanza y garantizar que los dividendos destinados a los municipios sean invertidos exclusivamente en obras de infraestructura social.\n\nReaño cerró su intervención recordando que las cajas municipales son la única experiencia estatal que ha demostrado gestión rentable y técnica en el sector financiero peruano.\n\n“Es la única experiencia empresarial estatal que rompe el mito de que el Estado no puede ser un empresario\", sentenció Reaño. \"40 años de empresarios en cajas municipales compitiendo con el sistema financiero privado representan un éxito absoluto.

Aunque al conductor le llamó la atención el pago ofrecido de S/26.50, al considerarlo alto para el corto tramo, aceptó brindar el encargo. “Necesito un delivery que me haga las compras de unas medicinas por Yape S/150. Una vez me traigan al punto B se le va a devolver y se le va a reconocer con S/220”, decía el pedido.\n\nTras aceptar llevar a cabo el servicio, el pasajero se comunicó con él por el chat de la aplicación para pedirle su número de WhatsApp, donde se llevó a cabo la estafa. “Me llama inmediatamente, informándome que tan pronto me encuentre en el Hospital Loayza me comunique con él para pasarme el QR del doctor que iba a entregarme supuestamente los medicamentos para llevarlos al punto acordado”, relató para las cámaras de Panamericana.\n\nPUEDES VER: Crhiss Vanger, el tiktoker acusado de estafar a más de 160 personas y generar S/1.500.000 con falsas inversiones\n\nPosteriormente, el supuesto médico le indicó que yapee S/120 al QR que le había enviado para que se efectúe la compra de suero fisiológico, dos ampollas y tres antibióticos, y que el monto lo iba a reembolsar una vez hiciera la entrega de los medicamentos.\n\n“Una vez le yapee, me dijo, espera un momento, ya va a salir el médico para entregarte los medicamentos. Nunca salió ningún médico, no tuve contacto con ninguno. Luego, me vuelve a llamar en cinco minutos, diciendo que iba a llevar un balón de oxígeno, el cual era un monto de S/200, que por favor lo pagara y él todo me lo iba a reconocer”, detalló.\n\nLa víctima afirmó que confió en el estafador tras escucharlo en la llamada como una persona con sencillez que se encontraba en el quirófano tratando a un paciente que había sufrido un accidente de tránsito. En un momento de la conversación oyó a una señora llorando y al supuesto médico pidiendo que le dieran un vaso de agua para que se calme. “Yo me preocupé porque es la vida de una persona y lo tomé enserio”, agregó.\n\nEl taxista hizo depósitos de hasta S/920 al estafador. Foto: Panamericana.\n\nLuego de cinco minutos, le comunicó que el doctor que le iba a entregar los fármacos no tenía balón de oxígeno pequeño, por lo que le pidió que yapee S/200 para adquirir uno de tamaño mediano. Transcurrido la misma cantidad de tiempo, el timador volvió a llamar para exigirle que deposite S/600 para una bolsa de sangre RH+, debido a que el paciente había perdido mucha sangre tras esperar mucho tiempo.\n\nCuando ya había pagado S/920, el taxista le pidió una prueba al supuesto galeno de que no se trataba de una estafa. Tras mostrarle un DNI en mal estado, el conductor desconfió y rechazó hacer más transacciones. En ese momento, el estafador lo bloqueó, quedándose con el dinero de la víctima. Al revisar el número al que envió el dinero, el chófer notó que se trataba de una línea con código postal de Bolivia (+591 60970892), a nombre de Yuseff Nataly Aguilar Miranda.\n\nEl caso ha sido expuesto por otros operadores de servicio por aplicativo en grupos de Facebook, donde alertan sobre esta nueva modalidad de estafa, mientras la app de transporte indicó que evaluará el caso\n\n¡Sigue a La República en WhatsApp!

Todo el humo entró a mi hogar mientras protegía a mi perrita\", sostuvo la vecina Paula en referencia al último siniestro en el lugar.\n\nLos vecinos, en su mayoría adultos mayores, contaron que durante el último siniestro el humo casi los termina por asfixiar. Además, precisaron que enfrentaron dificultades para evacuar, pues la humareda no les permitía saber en dónde estaban caminando. Por ello, un grupo de residentes realizó un plantón durante la mañana del sábado 8 de noviembre para exigir el apoyo de las autoridades ante la presencia de almacenes clandestinos. \"No queremos morir quemados\", se lee en uno de los carteles.\n\nLos residentes del edificio Moncayo denunciaron la presencia de almacenes y locales clandestinos.

En Lima opinan lo mismo el 84% de los consultados.\n\nUn 19%, en cambio, está a favor de que la exministra que avaló el quiebre constitucional en diciembre de 2022 haya solicitado asilo.\n\nPor lo pronto la pretensión de Chávez de abandonar el Perú tendrá que esperar. El Gobierno ha dejado en pausa la entrega del salvoconducto que solicitaba México. La Cancillería informó ayer que se propondrá a la OEA modificar la Convención de Caracas de 1945 para evitar el mal uso del asilo político. En un comunicado señaló que, por disposición del presidente José Jerí, se iniciarán consultas con otros países para garantizar el respeto a la ley en el continente. Tras estas gestiones urgentes, el Gobierno tomará una decisión sobre si entrega o no este documento a Chávez.\n\nPara el embajador Carlos Pareja, la respuesta de los encuestados refleja su rechazo a la actitud tomada por Chávez ante el proceso en su contra.\n\n“Comparto la opinión de esta amplia mayoría de ciudadanos. Chávez debe entregarse a la justicia y enfrentar su proceso judicial por rebelión y conspiración. La encuesta revela el rechazo de la gente por su actitud”, señaló el diplomático.\n\nIpsos también consultó a los entrevistados por la condena de 15 años de prisión impuesta al congresista Guillermo Bermejo por afiliación terrorista.

Fue una demostración de coraje, disciplina y unidad. Del 23 al 30 de octubre, los mejores hombres de las Fuerzas Armadas del Perú se enfrentaron a seis días de pruebas extremas que exigieron más que fuerza: temple, coordinación y confianza absoluta en sus compañeros.\n\nLa lideresa de Fuerza Popular elogió la película peruana \'Chavín de Huántar\' pero se mostró decepcionada por la omisión a su padre, Alberto Fujimori.\n\nEl nombre quechua Ayar Huñunakuy significa “la hermandad de los guerreros”, y ese fue el verdadero espíritu que se respiró durante la competencia. Bajo el lema “Una sola fuerza, un solo espíritu”, el Comando Conjunto de las Fuerzas Armadas (CCFFAA) reunió a equipos del Ejército, la Marina y la Fuerza Aérea, con el objetivo de reforzar la interoperabilidad y la camaradería que los une más allá de los uniformes.\n\nPerú21TV fue testigo de la competencia que se inició en la Escuela de Comandos del Ejército, en Chorrillos, con pruebas físicas y una carrera de 5.5 kilómetros con chaleco de 10 kilos.\n\nDe allí, el escenario cambió cada día, desafiando los límites de cada equipo en distintos entornos como marchas forzadas y resistencia en altura como lo fue en Cocachacra. En Punta Lobos se realizaron pruebas de tiro táctico y coordinación bajo presión. Y en el Callao, hubo maniobras anfibias y desplazamientos combinados tierra-mar.\n\n“Estos operadores especiales deben estar preparados para todos estos ambientes. Entrenamos para operar en distintos escenarios como en el Vraem, Putumayo, Pataz, entre otros”, dijo Hugo Vilca, capitán de Comando del Ejército.\n\nMás allá de la competencia, el Ayar Huñunakuy fortalece la interoperabilidad entre las Fuerzas Armadas, unificando tácticas y procedimientos para responder de forma conjunta cuando el país lo requiera.\n\nEn la clausura, celebrada el 30 de octubre, el equipo de Defensa y Operaciones Especiales (DOES) de la Fuerza Aérea del Perú se coronó campeón absoluto del Ayar Huñunakuy 2025, superando a sus pares de la Fuerza Especial Conjunta y la Fuerza de Operaciones Especiales (FOES) de la Marina de Guerra del Perú.\n\nEl jefe del CCFFAA, general de división David Ojeda, resaltó que el torneo “es una muestra del profesionalismo y la unidad que caracteriza a nuestras Fuerzas Armadas”. También subrayó que el nivel de preparación alcanzado “garantiza una respuesta conjunta ante cualquier amenaza interna o externa”.\n\n·Desde 2004, el Perú participa en la competencia internacional Fuerzas Comando, organizada por el Comando Sur de Estados Unidos, en la que los países americanos compiten por demostrar su preparación y capacidad táctica.\n\nRecibe tu Perú21 por correo electrónico o por Whatsapp. Suscríbete a nuestro periódico digital enriquecido.

Hoy contamos cómo otro hijo del líder de Podemos prometió construir una sede universitaria, no pagó, la propiedad quedó destruida y hoy enfrentan solo un proceso civil.\n\n“Vi que por ser congresista solo cobraba un sol de sueldo y lo demás lo donaba. Eso me dio confianza”, recuerda Rosanna Patrnogic mientras taxea de madrugada.\n\nLa mujer, de 54 años, se refiere a José Luna Gálvez. Actual congresista, dueño del partido Podemos Perú, candidato a la presidencia y fundador de la sancionada universidad Telesup.\n\nRosanna es madre soltera y técnico en computación, pero desde hace muchos años no encuentra trabajo en su oficio. La angustia por dinero, desde que firmó un contrato con Telesup, la obligó a ser “multichambas”.\n\nEn las mañanas cuida a su madre y funge de enfermera. Por las tardes hace trabajo de jardinería, a veces intenta vender casas -aún no tiene suerte- y por las noches abre Uber y se pone a trabajar en el carro que un generoso amigo le alquila a precio solidario.\n\nElla no conoce personalmente al candidato presidencial, José Luna. A quien sí conoce, y muy bien, es a su hijo: el actual regidor de Lima, José Luna Morales.\n\nEn mayo del 2017, Rosanna, su hermana y su madre, decidieron poner en alquiler un terreno familiar en Pucallpa, su tierra natal.\n\nSon 3,500 metros cuadrados con una casa de tres pisos, rodeada de jardines extensos. Cuando la familia se mudó a Lima el terreno quedó a cargo de un familiar, hasta que el 2017 decidieron alquilarlo. Fue entonces, cuando apareció en sus vidas Telesup.\n\nEn ese año aún no eran muy conocidas las denuncias por su pésima enseñanza y el cierre de la Universidad recién ocurrió en 2019.\n\nEn 2017 la intención de los Luna era construir una nueva sede de Telesup en Pucallpa. Por eso José Luna Morales, gerente de la universidad entonces, firmó un contrato con Rossana y Biserka Patrnogic y Esther la madre de ambas de 86 años.\n\n“Al igual que su padre, me agradó porque a diferencia de otros empresarios, fue muy campechano y conversador”, dice Rosanna de José Luna Morales, mientras rechaza un pasajero para seguir con la entrevista que nos ofrece para este reportaje.\n\nEl contrato es por 6 años, los Luna debían pagar 8 mil soles mensuales por el alquiler de su casa a las Patrnogic. Además, una cláusula advertía que en caso Telesup no consiguiera los permisos de ley para habilitar la sede, los Luna podían disolver el trato sin mayor perjuicio para ellos.\n\nFirmaron en mayo de 2017. Los primeros tres meses no hubo problemas. Sin embargo, en septiembre no pagaron el alquiler y desde entonces nunca más lo hicieron.\n\nLos Luna desaparecieron y al mismo tiempo, los vecinos de Rosanna en Pucallpa les mandaban fotos y mensajes que las angustiaban.\n\nGente desconocida había entrado a su propiedad. Rosanna llamó a los trabajadores de Telesup, encargados del terreno, pero dijeron que todo estaba bien. Pero era mentira.\n\nEn octubre, los Luna reaparecieron. Exigieron anular el contrato, afirmaron que la Superintendencia de Educación Superior (SUNEDU) no les dio la licencia para la nueva sede y que la Municipalidad de Coronel Portillo no les aprobó la licencia de funcionamiento.\n\nRosanna y su familia les creyeron. Los Luna les devolvieron su propiedad el 14 de octubre del 2017. Pero ese día empezó la desgracia de la familia Patrnogic.\n\n“Lo único que no se llevaron fue el cemento”, recuerda Rosanna mientras espera que el semáforo cambie a verde.\n\nLos videos que grabó demuestran que no exagera. Se llevaron las rejas, las tuberías, los cables eléctricos, destruyeron el triplay, las ventanas, las puertas, la bomba de agua, los closets, el tanque de agua y hasta los waters.\n\nUna de las cláusulas del contrato obligaba a Telesup a poner seguridad en el terreno para evitar los robos. No lo hicieron. “No digo que hayan sido ellos los que robaron, pero no cumplieron un acuerdo”, dice Rosana mientras otro chofer le toca el claxon, porque ya cambió a verde.\n\nRecién cuando vieron su propiedad destruida, empezaron a dudar de los Luna. Mandaron cartas a SUNEDU y a la Municipalidad de Coronel Portillo. Ambas instituciones respondieron: Telesup nunca inició un proceso de licenciamiento para la sede de Pucallpa.\n\nEse dato era crucial porque, según el contrato, si los Luna no justificaban una causa real para rescindir el contrato debían pagar el monto equivalente a un año de alquiler: 96 mil soles.\n\nNo quisieron pagar y fueron a una primera conciliación en enero del 2018. No llegaron a un acuerdo. Los Luna enviaron a una representante que no tenía ningún poder de decisión.\n\nPasaron casi dos años para una nueva conciliación. En ese lapso, Rosanna y su familia pidieron préstamos al banco para reparar los daños en su propiedad.\n\nEra diciembre del 2019, casi un año y medio después, Rosanna volvió a ver a José Luna Morales.\n\n“No habló nada. Lo único que hizo fue acercarse, me mostró un papel pequeño y arrugado, donde decía: Te puedo dar 30 mil”.\n\nNo hubo acuerdo. Al salir Rossana estalló en cólera, se recompuso, pero a los dos días una noticia en la televisión la indignó.\n\nLa policía encontró 300 mil soles debajo del asiento del carro de José Luna Morales. Lo hicieron durante una serie de allanamientos y detenciones contra el clan Luna, debido a una investigación fiscal.\n\nCuando los policías le preguntaron a Luna por el dinero, dijo que era el pago de las matrículas de Telesup.\n\nRosanna y su familia decidieron denunciar a Luna Morales penalmente por los delitos de estafa agravada, falsedad genérica y daños. A pesar de las pruebas, la Fiscalía de Pucallpa desestimó la denuncia.\n\nEn el 2021 iniciaron un proceso civil. La primera resolución les reconoció 104 mil soles de reparación.\n\nRossana dice que ese monto no cubre los daños, ni las deudas que asumieron para reconstruir la propiedad. Apelaron y, otra vez, una mala noticia.\n\nSu hermana mayor, Biserka, fue diagnosticada con cáncer. Las deudas se multiplicaron para salvarle la vida. Lucharon por tres años y, de nuevo, otra noticia devastadora.\n\nEn diciembre del año pasado, una nueva sentencia reconoció solo 96 mil soles. La familia pide cerca de 800 mil soles por los 8 años de angustias y penurias que viven.\n\nApelaron. Desde entonces, Rosanna va una vez al mes al Poder Judicial para ver si su caso avanza. La última vez le dijeron que en dos semanas habría resolución. Hace meses le dicen lo mismo.\n\nCuando la entrevisto es viernes por la noche, hay mucha gente saliendo de las discotecas de Miraflores. Ella trabajará hasta las 4 de la madrugada. Dormirá dos horas: a las seis debe llevar a su hermana a su sesión semanal de quimioterapias. Es cuando funge de enfermera.\n\nEn la casa que mantienen, en Surco, dejará a su madre de 92 años y a su hija adolecente, que también vive con ella.\n\nPara estas cuatro mujeres su vida cambió para siempre desde que conocieron a los Luna. Para los Luna todo sigue igual.\n\n', '/sites/default/efsfiles/styles/teaser/public/2025-11/estafa-5.png?itok=FiohIUVT', 'https://peru21.pe/investigacion/telesup-otra-familia-que-los-luna-dejaron-en-ruinas/', 'original', '2025-11-09 03:08:40', 0, 0, 5, NULL, '2025-11-09 03:08:40', '2025-11-09 03:08:40'),

El mensaje debe ser simple, directo y consistente: frases de acción, no de promesas\".\n\nVivimos una era de hipercomunicación, donde los mensajes políticos se multiplican sin control y el ruido digital opaca cualquier intento de conectar con claridad. En un contexto globalizado y tecnológicamente acelerado, las próximas elecciones exigirán estrategias mucho más segmentadas y discursos adaptados a cuatro o cinco generaciones con lógicas, valores y canales de información distintos.\n\nEn el Perú, la mayoría vota con resignación. Un 32% decide su voto en el último mes, más del 30% prefiere pagar la multa antes que ir a las urnas, y muchos admiten que los malos gobiernos son fruto de votar mal.\n\nUn estudio de Arellano Consultores confirma que más del 60% de los peruanos quiere un candidato que impulse el crecimiento y el empleo. El peruano promedio valora el esfuerzo y el trabajo, pero la inseguridad erosiona esa aspiración; por eso, la segunda prioridad es el orden.\n\nEl marketing político enfrenta un dilema: ¿cómo diferenciarse cuando todos prometen lo mismo? Seguridad, empleo, salud, educación... las palabras se repiten y pierden sentido. El país sufre de sobrediagnóstico y falta de ejecución; la ciudadanía lo sabe y responde con apatía.\n\nEl sociólogo José Antonio Marina lo resumió: “La economía se mundializa, los corazones se nacionalizan y las cabezas no saben lo que hay que hacer”. Ese desorden también habita en el votante peruano, que ya no confía en nadie. Ante ello, la estrategia política suele reducirse a tres ejes peligrosos: destruir al adversario con desinformación amplificada por IA, ofrecer promesas inviables y convertir al candidato en espectáculo.\n\nEsa fórmula desgastada explica la pérdida de autoridad moral y narrativa. El reto es reconstruir la credibilidad desde la comunicación. Hoy, el campo de batalla no está en la imagen, sino en lo que el candidato instala en la mente del elector: ocupar espacio con dos o tres ideas claras que generen confianza.\n\nEl votante peruano responde a la autenticidad, la experiencia y la coherencia. El mensaje debe ser simple, directo y consistente: frases de acción, no de promesas. La simplicidad no implica superficialidad. Implica claridad estratégica. Un mensaje coherente, sostenido y segmentado puede transformar percepciones, incluso en un entorno tan fragmentado como el peruano. Cada voto vale igual, pero no todos los votantes piensan igual. Entender esa diversidad es la nueva ventaja competitiva del marketing político moderno.\n\nEl Perú no necesita más campañas, sino más visión. La comunicación debe volver a ser un instrumento de transformación y no una herramienta de manipulación. Solo así podremos aspirar a elecciones más limpias, debates más profundos y un país que empiece a cambiar desde la palabra, la coherencia y la acción.\n\n', '/sites/default/efsfiles/styles/teaser/public/2025-07/799135_1.jpg?itok=yFAgYdAF', 'https://peru21.pe/opinion/cuando-el-marketing-politico-no-es-suficiente-por-marco-antonio-merino/', 'original', '2025-11-09 03:08:42', 0, 0, 5, NULL, '2025-11-09 03:08:42', '2025-11-09 03:08:42'),

La clave no está en educar en base al castigo, sino en enseñar con empatía y firmeza, tal como propone la disciplina positiva de Jane Nelsen (Positive Discipline, 2023). Este enfoque busca guiar a los niños con cariño y límites claros, ayudándolos a desarrollar autocontrol y respeto por los demás.\n\nAlgunas prácticas que podemos aplicar tanto en el colegio como en nuestros hogares son la construcción de normas claras y consensuadas. En el colegio, se deben definir las normas de convivencia con la participación de los estudiantes —por ejemplo, acordar que “nos tratamos con respeto” o “resolvemos los conflictos hablando”—. Así, los estudiantes se sienten parte de la comunidad y cumplen las reglas con mayor compromiso.\n\nEn casa, también necesitamos normas que establezcan límites firmes y coherentes. Deben ser adecuadas para la edad de nuestros hijos, construirse en conjunto y asegurarnos de que las comprendan. Además, deben saber cuáles serán las consecuencias en caso de no cumplirlas y, si se equivocan, enseñarles a reparar el daño —pedir disculpas o ayudar al afectado— vale más que un castigo.\n\nEs necesario también tener la capacidad de escuchar sin juzgar. Interesarse por cómo fue el día de nuestros hijos, notar cambios de ánimo o actitudes extrañas puede marcar la diferencia. Frases como “no exageres” o “defiéndete tú solo” solo aumentan el miedo o la culpa. Lo mejor es decir: “Estoy contigo, busquemos ayuda”.\n\nLas escuelas deben seguir fortaleciendo los programas de tutoría, los espacios seguros y las campañas donde los propios estudiantes promuevan el respeto. Combatir el acoso no es tarea es una tarea de todos los días donde las familias y las escuelas deben trabajar juntas. Si cada miembro de la familia se comporta con respeto y cada escuela escucha a tiempo, lograremos que los estudiantes se sientan protegidos y valorados.\n\n', '/sites/default/efsfiles/styles/teaser/public/2023-10/KCUDIXTNVZAZDBN6OIYEJE37Q4.jpg?itok=4v9alS-g', 'https://peru21.pe/opinion/familias-y-colegios-aliados-contra-el-acoso-por-jessyca-sampe/', 'original', '2025-11-09 03:08:43', 0, 0, 5, NULL, '2025-11-09 03:08:43', '2025-11-09 03:08:43'),

Pero la realidad contradice su narrativa: su bancada fue una de las que respaldó el retorno del Senado y la reelección parlamentaria.\n\nEl líder de Renovación Popular también aprovechó el evento empresarial para negar cualquier relación con mineros informales, ofreciendo incluso “100 mil dólares por cada prueba” que demuestre lo contrario. Sin embargo, el registro de votaciones del Congreso muestra que su agrupación apoyó medidas que benefician a la minería no formal, mientras se registran al menos tres personas pertenecientes a este sector en las filas de su partido.\n\nPUEDES VER: Trenes Caltrain están en mal estado en el Parque La Muralla y gestión de López Aliaga se victimiza\n\nLas declaraciones de López Aliaga en el CADE 2025 reflejan su estrategia de campaña: presentarse como un político antisistema mientras su partido reproduce las mismas prácticas que dice combatir. Las contradicciones entre su discurso público y la actuación parlamentaria de Renovación Popular lo exponen como un dirigente dispuesto a distorsionar la realidad para ganar terreno electoral.\n\nEstas inconsistencias se suman a un historial de promesas incumplidas del también exalcalde de Lima, cuya gestión municipal es cuestionada por obras inconclusas, falta de transparencia y disputas internas. En el ámbito nacional, su discurso populista busca posicionarlo para las elecciones de 2026, pero los hechos revelan un liderazgo carente de coherencia.\n\nPUEDES VER: Al mismo estilo del fujimorismo, Rafael López Aliaga propone jueces sin rostro para casos de extorsión y sicariato\n\nEn su intervención en la CADE 2025, Rafael López Aliaga aseguró que eliminaría la bicameralidad si llega al poder. Sin embargo, en marzo de 2024, el Congreso aprobó con 91 votos a favor la reforma constitucional que restableció el sistema bicameral, y la bancada de Renovación Popular fue una de las que mostró respaldo a la iniciativa.\n\nEntre los congresistas que apoyaron el retorno del Senado estuvieron José Cueto, Jorge Montoya y Alejandro Muñante, todos miembros de Renovación Popular en ese entonces. El propio López Aliaga no se pronunció en ese momento en contra de la reforma, lo que muestra una doble postura frente a un tema clave de gobernabilidad. Su promesa de ahora contrasta con la conducta previa de su agrupación.\n\nAdemás, durante su exposición en la CADE, el alcalde capitalino anunció que reduciría el salario de los parlamentarios: “El sueldo del congresista será el promedio de su sueldo en los últimos cinco años”, dijo. La frase buscó reforzar su imagen de austeridad, aunque en la práctica su partido ha defendido mayores beneficios y presupuestos para el Legislativo.\n\nPUEDES VER: Fernán Altuve arremete contra López Aliaga: “Su tendencia hacia la extrema derecha es preocupante”\n\nEn la misma cita empresarial, Rafael López Aliaga negó cualquier vínculo de su partido con la minería informal, afirmando con tono desafiante: “Te pago cien mil dólares por cada uno que tú me demuestres”. Sin embargo, según Infobae Perú, la bancada de Renovación Popular votó a favor de la ampliación del Registro Integral de Formalización Minera (REINFO), una medida criticada por facilitar la actividad de mineros informales y proteger operaciones fuera del marco legal.\n\nEl caso más representativo es el de Máximo Béquer, presidente de Confederación Nacional de Pequeña Minería y Minería Artesanal del Perú (Confemin), un empresario minero que fue vinculado a Renovación Popular y luego se apartó tras cuestionamientos por su relación con la minería no formal. Aunque el partido intentó desvincularse, el episodio evidencia la cercanía de algunos integrantes con ese sector económico. Según el Registro de Organizaciones Políticas (ROP), actualmente se encuentran inscritos Magno Palomino Garamendi, Javier Bernal Salas y Rossbel Anyosa Pariona, también integrantes de Confemin.\n\nLas declaraciones de López Aliaga son, por tanto, inconsistentes con la actuación legislativa de su bancada.

En tanto, para el de Senado, los ahora parlamentarios Eduardo Salhuana, Martha Moyano, Fernando Rospigliosi, Waldemar Cerrón y Patricia Chirinos buscan repetir el plato.\n\nEllos votaron a favor de algunas de las leyes, mientras que en otras mostraron su postura en contra, se abstuvieron o estuvieron ausentes. Sin embargo, de los 130 parlamentarios resaltan ocho que votaron a favor en las seis normas que afectan la función fiscal y favorecen a las organizaciones criminales\n\nSe trata de los congresistas fujimoristas Ernesto Bustamante, Mery Infantes y Héctor Ventura. Y los legisladores José Luna Gálvez y José Arriola (ambos de Podemos), Jorge Morante y Héctor Valer (de Somos Perú). Por último, el perúlibrista Flavio Cruz.\n\nPUEDES VER: Betssy Chávez y Pedro Castillo: Subcomisión del Congreso aprueba informe final de inhabilitación por 10 años\n\nEl proyecto de Ley Nº 00565/2021-CR (ahora Ley 31990) fue promulgada el 21 de marzo del 2024 y modificaba los artículos 473, 476-a y 481-a del Código Penal, referidos al proceso especial por colaboración eficaz.\n\nCon esta norma el trámite entre la solicitud del aspirante y la firma o rechazo del acuerdo no puede superar los 8 meses, prorrogables por 4 meses más, y excepcionalmente 8 meses adicionales si se trata de crimen organizado. Antes de esta ley, la Fiscalía tenía libertad de plazos para corroborar la información entregada por los colaboradores.\n\nEsta primera ley ‘procrimen’ fue planteada por Podemos Perú en el 2021 y tenía como autora a la parlamentaria María Teresa Cabrera Vega. Si bien ella no está tentando la reelección, los congresistas José Arriola, Heidy Juárez, José Luna (líder del partido) y Guido Bellido, pertenecientes a esta bancada, votaron en su momento a favor de aprobar la polémica norma. Hoy todos ellos intentan continuar en el Congreso por al menos un periodo más.\n\nCabe precisar que uno de los principales defensores de modificar la ley de colaboración eficaz fue el congresista Waldemar Cerrón, quien afirmó que muchos casos “solo han servido para mantener a las personas en vilo” debido a que tiempo después quienes se acogieron a dicha figura se retractaron de sus acusaciones\n\nNueve congresistas de Perú Libre, incluyendo a Cerrón, votaron a favor de esta norma. Además del ahora segundo vicepresidente del Congreso, Kelly Portalatino, Flavio Cruz y Segundo Montalvo, que apoyaron esta iniciativa, buscan reelegirse como senadores con el partido del lápiz.\n\nOtros de los nombres de la lista de “reelegibles” que dieron su voto para aprobar esta norma son: Fernando Rosipligliosi, Ernesto Bustamente, Norma Yarrow, Alfredo Azurín, Hector Valer y José Williams. La ley fue promulgada con la venia de Acción Popular, Alianza Para el Progreso, Avanza país, Renobación Popular y Somos Perú\n\nOtra de las normas conocidas como ‘procrimen’ se trata de la Ley 32326, promulgada el 9 mayo de este año, la cual tuvo su origen en el proyecto de ley N.º 03577/2022‑CR presentado por el congresista Jorge Morante.\n\nLa norma además contaba con las firmas de Jeny López, Rosangella Barbarán Reyes, Nilza Chacón, César Revilla, Héctor Ventura y Juan Carlos Lizarzaburu. Todos los mencionados votaron a favor de su aprobación en el Pleno y ya calientan para entrar al ruedo en las próximas elecciones.\n\nAdemás de ellos, otros de los fujimoristas que legislaron para modificar la extinción de dominio y pretender ser reelegidos son: Arturo Alegría, Ernesto Bustamante, Enrique Castillo, Víctor Flores, Mery Infantes, Tania Ramírez y María Zeta\n\nCabe precisar que esta ley condiciona el proceso de extinción de dominio a la existencia de una sentencia firme, bloqueando la recuperación temprana de activos ilícitos provenientes de la corrupción y el lavado de activos.\n\nPUEDES VER: Antauro Humala a Rosa María Palacios: \"Si tú crees que soy xenófobo, soy xenófobo y a mucha honra\"\n\nAdemás de Podemos y Fuerza Popular, desde Perú Libre también se gestaron las bases para normas que permiten la criminalidad.\n\nTal es el caso del proyecto de ley Nº 06084/2023‑CR, vinculado a la Ley N°32054, que excluye a los partidos políticos de toda sanción penal y administrativa por delitos cometidos mediante su estructura, incluso si sus dirigentes o candidatos están involucrados en actos de corrupción o lavado de dinero.\n\nEl proyecto fue presentado por Waldemar Cerrón (Perú Libre), cuyo hermano Vladimir Cerrón, y fundador del partido, es investigado. Para la aprobación de esta norma desde el partido del lápiz también votaron a favor Flavio Cruz, quien además apoyó en bloque las otras cinco leyes ‘procrimen’, y Segundo Montalvo. Ambos pretenden ser elegidos como senadores en 2026.\n\nLos votos para esta ley que benefició a los partidos políticos fue aprobada con una mayoría de 87 votos. De este gran bloque 56 parlamentarios postularán para la reelección. Entre ellos están José Cueto por Renovación Popular, María del Carmen Alva con Acción Popular, Alex Paredes de Somos Perú, Patricia Júarez de Fuerza Popular y Adriana Tudela de Avanza País.\n\nEl Proyecto de Ley 06838/2023-CR fue una iniciativa presentada por Jorge Marticorena de Alianza para el Progreso. Su proyecto derivó en lo que sería la Ley N°31989, que debilita la capacidad de la PNP para combatir la tenencia ilegal de materiales explosivos en actividades mineras ejecutadas por personas con inscripción suspendida en el REINFO.\n\nAdemás de Marticorena, otros siete congresistas de Alianza Para el Progreso se postularán el el 2026 para el congreso bicameral. Todos ellos votaron a favor de esta norma que beneficia a la minería ilegal. Edith Julón es la única que busca ir a la cámara de Diputados, mientras que Lady Camones, Roberto Chiabra (con el partido Unidad Nacional), José Elías, Nelcy Heidinger, Magaly Ruiz y Eduardo Salhuana tentarán un escaño en el Senado.\n\nFinalmente, las otras dos leyes ‘procrimen’ vinieron desde la unión de Fuerza Popular, Avanza País y Alianza para el Progreso. La Ley 32130 permitió que la PNP asuma la conducción de la investigación preliminar, afectando la autonomía del Ministerio Público.\n\nLa iniciativa fue planteada por dos nombres predominantes en la lista de favorecedores de las leyes ‘procrimen’ a través de sus votos: Fernando Rospigliosi y Patricia Chirinos. Ambos a su vez buscan continuar un periodo más, pero esta vez en el Senado, la cámara reflexiva.\n\nPor su parte, la Ley N.º 32138, nació como propuesta de Eduardo Salhuana, expresidente del Congreso y próximo candidato a la Cámara de Senadores con el partido de César Acuña. La cuestionada norma introdujo modificaciones significativas a la Ley contra el Crimen Organizado (Ley 30077). El Ministerio Público cuestionó la norma rápidamente porque consideró que su verdadero efecto es debilitar la persecución penal y reducir el alcance de las investigaciones por crimen organizado y corrupción.', 'https://imgmedia.larepublica.pe/127x77/larepublica/original/2025/11/09/691093e32bfefcf6860d34fc.webp', 'https://larepublica.pe/politica/2025/11/09/parlamentarios-que-votaron-a-favor-de-las-leyes-pro-crimen-podrian-postular-al-congreso-bicameral-hnews-502103', 'original', '2025-11-09 22:55:11', 0, 0, 5, NULL, '2025-11-09 22:55:11', '2025-11-09 22:55:11'),

Dos de los candidatos a la presidencia se presentaron en la 63.ª edición del CADE Ejecutivos y la mayoría de ellos brilló por su ausencia, en un momento en el que se necesitan escuchar propuestas para enfrentar la inseguridad ciudadana, combatir las actividades ilícitas y reorientar la senda de bajo crecimiento económico que hoy está estancado en tasas del 3%.\n\nSegún la encuesta divulgada por IPSOS al finalizar el foro empresarial, los líderes de diversas compañías estiman que el ritmo de la actividad productiva será más moderado en el 2026 y alcanzará un 3,2%, lo que revela un mayor optimismo frente a las proyecciones del año anterior. No obstante, dicha previsión sigue estando por debajo de su potencial histórico. Recordemos que entre el 2003 y el 2013, el Perú creció en promedio 6% anual y la inversión privada lo hizo en 15%.\n\nPUEDES VER: Confiep: \"Hay que retomar el mecanismo técnico que define el aumento del sueldo mínimo\"\n\n“Si nos comparamos con otros países de la región, las cifras son positivas, pero insuficientes. Con tasas del 3% no sacamos a la gente de la pobreza. Necesitamos crecer a un mínimo de 5%. Como bien mencionó uno de los últimos reportes del Banco Central de Reserva, tenemos el potencial para hacerlo”, indicó a este medio Jaime Dupuy, director ejecutivo de la Sociedad de Comercio Exterior del Perú (ComexPerú).\n\nY es que, no se puede dejar de lado que existen una serie de factores internos que limitan el despegue del PBI. Uno de ellos es la inseguridad, que se ha convertido en la principal preocupación de los empresarios por encima de la corrupción. De hecho, un 89% de ellos cree que se ha retrocedido en la lucha contra este flagelo desde el 2021. En su último Marco Macroeconómico Multianual (MMM) 2026-2029, el Ministerio de Economía y Finanzas (MEF) estimó que su costo asciende a S/19.800 millones, lo que equivale a alrededor del 1,7% del PBI de este año\n\nEn segundo lugar, aparecen otros elementos estructurales que merman el desempeño de la economía peruana: la baja productividad, la alta informalidad y el deterioro institucional, que se ve reflejado en la sucesión desordenada de presidentes y en la pérdida de confianza ciudadana en el sistema político. Pero, sin lugar a dudas, los empresarios (79%) consideran que el combate efectivo de la delincuencia es la demanda central que contribuirá a la reactivación de la inversión privada.\n\nPUEDES VER: José Jerí inyecta ánimo a empresarios con proyecciones optimistas en CADE Ejecutivos: “Ordenaremos la casa”\n\nEn agosto, la economía peruana creció 3,18%, sostenida por los sectores comercio, agropecuario, construcción y minería e hidrocarburos, según datos del INEI. No obstante, este último rubro que contribuye casi con el 15% del PBI, no alcanza tasas importantes desde el 2023 y su ritmo de expansión se mantiene por debajo del 2%.\n\n“Para crecer más, necesitamos más Quellavecos, más Cerro Verdes y más Antaminas. La única forma de lograrlo es acelerando exploraciones y materializando la cartera de proyectos que ya están en diferentes etapas a fin de convertirse en una realidad. Esto significará más puestos de trabajo y bienestar para las comunidades”, explicó a este medio Julia Torreblanca, presidenta de la Sociedad Nacional de Minería, Energía y Petróleo (SNMPE).\n\nPese al contexto internacional favorable por los altos precios de metales como el oro, que supera la barrera de los US$4.000 por onza, resulta paradójico que sus efectos no se traduzcan en más inversiones y que la producción formal no se expanda. La respuesta podría encontrarse en la ausencia de grandes proyectos de clase mundial, una conflictividad social latente y el avance de la minería informal e ilegal.\n\nDicha actividad ilícita ya no solo se concentra en Madre de Dios, Puno o La Libertad, ahora también crece en otras regiones del centro y de la Amazonía peruana. En opinión de Torreblanca, resulta preocupante que las exportaciones de oro ilegal vayan a equiparar o superar a los envíos formales de este metal dorado (US$12.000 millones), puesto que significa una fuga de recursos significativos.\n\nRespecto al comportamiento del sector minero, Gabriel Arrieta, jefe de Estudios Económicos e Inteligencia Comercial del CIEN-ADEX, destacó el crecimiento del valor exportado del cobre y el oro, frente a los datos del año pasado. No obstante, sostiene que, en nivel de volumen, las cifras son bajas.\n\n“Los factores precio e incertidumbre están impulsando el crecimiento del sector minero, pero a nivel de volumen, estamos exportando poco. En el caso del oro, los países están observándolo como un refugio de valor importante. Entonces, su demanda está aumentando y eso impulsa la exportación de oro bruto”, analizó.\n\nSegún las proyecciones que compartió CIEN-Adex a este medio, los despachos mineros hacia el exterior cerrarían el año con un alza de 18,8% y para el 2026, se estima una tasa del 3,4%, lo que evidencia un avance menor al del 2025. En total, las exportaciones peruanas sumarían US$90.428 millones, es decir, un incremento de 4,3%.\n\nDe acuerdo con Jaime Dupuy, nuestro país ha venido creciendo pese a la inestabilidad política de los últimos años. Si bien, las decisiones de inversión podrían detenerse en función a la incertidumbre electoral del 2026, se necesitan propuestas. Algunas de ellas deben enfocarse en una reforma en la gestión pública y en el aumento de la productividad. Esto significa, que el Estado tiene que ser eficiente en su funcionamiento y a su vez, darle facilidades a la inversión privada. Además, otro punto importante es destinar más recursos al capital físico, humano y tecnológico.\n\n“Tenemos que pensar cómo enfrentar de una forma inteligente el tema de la formalización. Esto implica reestructurar los marcos legales en temas tributarios, laborales y regulatorios municipales, de modo que sean más flexibles y fáciles de cumplir.”, agregó.\n\nPara Gabriel Arrieta, los planes de gobierno de los candidatos presidenciales deben contener propuestas para emprender una reforma educativa, mejorar la productividad laboral, continuar con la agenda de apertura comercial y diseñar un plan asociado a la reducción de costos logísticos. Puso como ejemplo el Megapuerto de Chancay, que necesita trabajadores preparados con dominio de idiomas y resolver la falta de infraestructura para maximizar su impacto.\n\nPor su parte, Julia Torreblanca indicó que el compromiso de las próximas autoridades debe centrarse en simplificar permisos, reducir plazos y fortalecer los mecanismos de formalización. En esa línea, hizo un llamado a garantizar la políca macroeconómica y asegurar que se cumplan las reglas fiscales fijadas por el MEF.\n\n“Si queremos crecer a tasas diferentes y alcanzar mejores niveles de desarrollo, debemos hacer un quiebre y asegurarnos que las economías ilegales y la informalidad pasen hacia la formalidad. Que paguen sus impuestos, que cumplan sus permisos y las normas.”, añadió.\n\nLo cierto es que el empresariado persiste en su desconfianza institucional, aunque con menos pesimismo. El 32% de los ejecutivos considera que el país está retrocediendo, una cifra inferior al 64% registrado en 2024. De cara al 2026, la encuesta de IPSOS recoge prioridades: lucha contra la corrupción (75%), facilitación de inversión (61%), mejorar la seguridad (58%), desarrollar infraestructura (47%) y mantener la estabilidad económica (42%).\n\nPara Jorge Zapata, presidente de la CONFIEP, el gobierno debe cuidar la estabilidad macroeconómica y garantizar su sostenibilidad fiscal. “Hay que ponerle freno a estos proyectos populistas que vienen del Congreso porque van a deteriorar el único activo que tenemos. Debemos buscar que el Estado sea más eficiente”, enfatizó.\n\nRecordó que, a comienzos de siglo, el Perú crecía entre 5% y 8%, lo cual ayudó a la lucha contra la pobreza. Por ende, se necesita retomar la senda expansiva a través de darle mayores facilidades al sector privado y estimular que los negocios avancen. “Lo único que nos queda son nuestros números macroeconómicos”, dijo.', 'https://imgmedia.larepublica.pe/480x264/larepublica/original/2025/11/09/690fc1066e9a042bb0015058.webp', 'https://larepublica.pe/economia/2025/11/09/empresarios-peruanos-proyectan-un-crecimiento-economico-moderado-en-2026-ano-de-incertidumbre-electoral-hnews-388752', 'original', '2025-11-09 22:55:13', 0, 0, 5, NULL, '2025-11-09 22:55:13', '2025-11-09 22:55:13'),

Hasta la fecha, lleva 10 días desaparecida. De acuerdo con las cámaras de seguridad revisadas por la madre, el hecho ocurrió aproximadamente 6:40 p. m. En las imágenes, la mujer observó que el mototaxi se dirigía inicialmente hacia su vivienda; sin embargo, poco después el vehículo dio la vuelta y tomó otro camino. “Nunca más se volvió a ver a mi hija ni a la moto”, declaró la señora García a La República.\n\nSegún propias indagaciones, la madre de familia logró obtener el número telefónico y el nombre del conductor que habría llevado a su hija: Eduardo Julio Manguinuri Polo. Al comunicarse con él, el sujeto aseguró no saber nada del caso y negó que alguien se hubiera subido a su vehículo. Al día siguiente, la madre volvió a llamar, con la esperanza de obtener más información, pero esta vez respondió una mujer, quien afirmó que su esposo no trabajaba como taxista. Sin embargo, durante la conversación, ella describió el mototaxi de su pareja, cuya apariencia coincidía exactamente con la que la madre había visto en las imágenes de seguridad. Al ser consultada por la placa del vehículo, la mujer se negó a dársela rotundamente.\n\nPUEDES VER: Le ofrecieron invertir en proyecto escolar y terminó perdiendo S/120.000: \"Me pagarán en 45 cuotas para 2029\"\n\nDebido a su insistencia, la señora García logró concertar un encuentro en la vivienda de la mujer, con el propósito de confirmar si el número de placa coincidía con el que había visto en las cámaras de seguridad. Antes de ello, la madre acudió a la Policía Nacional del Perú (PNP) y solicitó que agentes la acompañaran de manera encubierta. Para su sorpresa, la mujer le comentó que tanto ella como su esposo conocían a los policías y que sabían que estaban siendo seguidos. Cuando llegaron a la casa, los agentes finalmente se acercaron y le pidieron a la mujer que mostrara la placa del vehículo: era la misma que la señora García había identificado en las grabaciones de seguridad.\n\n“Ahí les digo a los policías que hay una prueba más de que ellos sí tienen a mi hija”, relató la señora García. Sin embargo, pese a ello, no se tomó ninguna acción inmediata.

Este hecho le resultó sospechoso, ya que en el aviso de búsqueda figuraba únicamente su propio número y no el de terceras personas.\n\nPUEDES VER: Falso pasajero se hace pasar por médico y estafa a taxista con casi S/1.000: le pedía yapear para medicamentos\n\nDías después, otro número se comunicó directamente con la señora García.

Sin embargo, el día acordado, estas personas nunca aparecieron.\n\nAl inicio de la desaparición, las autoridades le dijeron a la madre que debía esperar, argumentando que, en algunos casos, las adolescentes “salen con enamorados”, minimizando así la gravedad del hecho. Finalmente, gracias a su insistencia, la señora García logró que el caso pasara a manos de la Fiscalía, donde se encuentra actualmente a la espera de que se emita la orden correspondiente para que las autoridades realicen los interrogatorios necesarios.\n\n¡Sigue a La República en WhatsApp!

Hoy contamos cómo otro hijo del líder de Podemos prometió construir una sede universitaria, no pagó, la propiedad quedó destruida y hoy enfrentan solo un proceso civil.\n\n“Vi que por ser congresista solo cobraba un sol de sueldo y lo demás lo donaba. Eso me dio confianza”, recuerda Rosanna Patrnogic mientras taxea de madrugada.\n\nLa mujer, de 54 años, se refiere a José Luna Gálvez. Actual congresista, dueño del partido Podemos Perú, candidato a la presidencia y fundador de la sancionada universidad Telesup.\n\nRosanna es madre soltera y técnico en computación, pero desde hace muchos años no encuentra trabajo en su oficio. La angustia por dinero, desde que firmó un contrato con Telesup, la obligó a ser “multichambas”.\n\nEn las mañanas cuida a su madre y funge de enfermera. Por las tardes hace trabajo de jardinería, a veces intenta vender casas -aún no tiene suerte- y por las noches abre Uber y se pone a trabajar en el carro que un generoso amigo le alquila a precio solidario.\n\nElla no conoce personalmente al candidato presidencial, José Luna. A quien sí conoce, y muy bien, es a su hijo: el actual regidor de Lima, José Luna Morales.\n\nEn mayo del 2017, Rosanna, su hermana y su madre, decidieron poner en alquiler un terreno familiar en Pucallpa, su tierra natal.\n\nSon 3,500 metros cuadrados con una casa de tres pisos, rodeada de jardines extensos. Cuando la familia se mudó a Lima el terreno quedó a cargo de un familiar, hasta que el 2017 decidieron alquilarlo. Fue entonces, cuando apareció en sus vidas Telesup.\n\nEn ese año aún no eran muy conocidas las denuncias por su pésima enseñanza y el cierre de la Universidad recién ocurrió en 2019.\n\nEn 2017 la intención de los Luna era construir una nueva sede de Telesup en Pucallpa. Por eso José Luna Morales, gerente de la universidad entonces, firmó un contrato con Rossana y Biserka Patrnogic y Esther la madre de ambas de 86 años.\n\n“Al igual que su padre, me agradó porque a diferencia de otros empresarios, fue muy campechano y conversador”, dice Rosanna de José Luna Morales, mientras rechaza un pasajero para seguir con la entrevista que nos ofrece para este reportaje.\n\nEl contrato es por 6 años, los Luna debían pagar 8 mil soles mensuales por el alquiler de su casa a las Patrnogic. Además, una cláusula advertía que en caso Telesup no consiguiera los permisos de ley para habilitar la sede, los Luna podían disolver el trato sin mayor perjuicio para ellos.\n\nFirmaron en mayo de 2017. Los primeros tres meses no hubo problemas. Sin embargo, en septiembre no pagaron el alquiler y desde entonces nunca más lo hicieron.\n\nLos Luna desaparecieron y al mismo tiempo, los vecinos de Rosanna en Pucallpa les mandaban fotos y mensajes que las angustiaban.\n\nGente desconocida había entrado a su propiedad. Rosanna llamó a los trabajadores de Telesup, encargados del terreno, pero dijeron que todo estaba bien. Pero era mentira.\n\nEn octubre, los Luna reaparecieron. Exigieron anular el contrato, afirmaron que la Superintendencia de Educación Superior (SUNEDU) no les dio la licencia para la nueva sede y que la Municipalidad de Coronel Portillo no les aprobó la licencia de funcionamiento.\n\nRosanna y su familia les creyeron. Los Luna les devolvieron su propiedad el 14 de octubre del 2017. Pero ese día empezó la desgracia de la familia Patrnogic.\n\n“Lo único que no se llevaron fue el cemento”, recuerda Rosanna mientras espera que el semáforo cambie a verde.\n\nLos videos que grabó demuestran que no exagera. Se llevaron las rejas, las tuberías, los cables eléctricos, destruyeron el triplay, las ventanas, las puertas, la bomba de agua, los closets, el tanque de agua y hasta los waters.\n\nUna de las cláusulas del contrato obligaba a Telesup a poner seguridad en el terreno para evitar los robos. No lo hicieron. “No digo que hayan sido ellos los que robaron, pero no cumplieron un acuerdo”, dice Rosana mientras otro chofer le toca el claxon, porque ya cambió a verde.\n\nRecién cuando vieron su propiedad destruida, empezaron a dudar de los Luna. Mandaron cartas a SUNEDU y a la Municipalidad de Coronel Portillo. Ambas instituciones respondieron: Telesup nunca inició un proceso de licenciamiento para la sede de Pucallpa.\n\nEse dato era crucial porque, según el contrato, si los Luna no justificaban una causa real para rescindir el contrato debían pagar el monto equivalente a un año de alquiler: 96 mil soles.\n\nNo quisieron pagar y fueron a una primera conciliación en enero del 2018. No llegaron a un acuerdo. Los Luna enviaron a una representante que no tenía ningún poder de decisión.\n\nPasaron casi dos años para una nueva conciliación. En ese lapso, Rosanna y su familia pidieron préstamos al banco para reparar los daños en su propiedad.\n\nEra diciembre del 2019, casi un año y medio después, Rosanna volvió a ver a José Luna Morales.\n\n“No habló nada. Lo único que hizo fue acercarse, me mostró un papel pequeño y arrugado, donde decía: Te puedo dar 30 mil”.\n\nNo hubo acuerdo. Al salir Rossana estalló en cólera, se recompuso, pero a los dos días una noticia en la televisión la indignó.\n\nLa policía encontró 300 mil soles debajo del asiento del carro de José Luna Morales. Lo hicieron durante una serie de allanamientos y detenciones contra el clan Luna, debido a una investigación fiscal.\n\nCuando los policías le preguntaron a Luna por el dinero, dijo que era el pago de las matrículas de Telesup.\n\nRosanna y su familia decidieron denunciar a Luna Morales penalmente por los delitos de estafa agravada, falsedad genérica y daños. A pesar de las pruebas, la Fiscalía de Pucallpa desestimó la denuncia.\n\nEn el 2021 iniciaron un proceso civil. La primera resolución les reconoció 104 mil soles de reparación.\n\nRossana dice que ese monto no cubre los daños, ni las deudas que asumieron para reconstruir la propiedad. Apelaron y, otra vez, una mala noticia.\n\nSu hermana mayor, Biserka, fue diagnosticada con cáncer. Las deudas se multiplicaron para salvarle la vida. Lucharon por tres años y, de nuevo, otra noticia devastadora.\n\nEn diciembre del año pasado, una nueva sentencia reconoció solo 96 mil soles. La familia pide cerca de 800 mil soles por los 8 años de angustias y penurias que viven.\n\nApelaron. Desde entonces, Rosanna va una vez al mes al Poder Judicial para ver si su caso avanza. La última vez le dijeron que en dos semanas habría resolución. Hace meses le dicen lo mismo.\n\nCuando la entrevisto es viernes por la noche, hay mucha gente saliendo de las discotecas de Miraflores. Ella trabajará hasta las 4 de la madrugada. Dormirá dos horas: a las seis debe llevar a su hermana a su sesión semanal de quimioterapias. Es cuando funge de enfermera.\n\nEn la casa que mantienen, en Surco, dejará a su madre de 92 años y a su hija adolecente, que también vive con ella.\n\nPara estas cuatro mujeres su vida cambió para siempre desde que conocieron a los Luna. Para los Luna todo sigue igual.', NULL, 'https://peru21.pe/investigacion/telesup-otra-familia-que-los-luna-dejaron-en-ruinas/', 'original', '2025-11-09 22:56:57', 0, 0, 5, NULL, '2025-11-09 22:56:57', '2025-11-09 22:56:57');

Asimismo, el órgano judicial señaló en su resolución que la entidad no cumplió con la medida cautelar que ordena reponer a la fiscal suspendida y suspender totalmente el proceso disciplinario que pesaba sobre ella.\n\nDe acuerdo con el documento oficial, la citación se reprogramó debido a que Espinoza no se conectó virtualmente a una convocatoria anterior.

Se invirtieron montos desde los S/12 hasta más de S/100.000, distribuidos en alrededor de 30.000 transacciones entre IPCH A e IPCH B.\n\nDe acuerdo con analistas consultados, el impulso que le dieron los medios de comunicación e influencers hizo de este fenómeno posible. Sin embargo, no todos ganaron, en realidad, algunas de estas personas que ahorraron slash invirtieron en acciones de Inversiones Puerto de Chancay, están en rojo.\n\nMegapuerto de Chancay en primera fase. Foto: Cosco Shipping\n\nPUEDES VER: Megapuerto de Chancay supera los S/530 millones en recaudación y bate récord con cargamentos de cemento y vehículos\n\n“La ola de nuevos inversionistas fueron advertidos por Kallpa SAB —intermediaria que concentra el 90% de la BVL— que era una inversión de alto riesgo. Varios se entusiasmaron, invirtieron, y a algunos les fue bien y a otros les fue mal”, contó Alberto Arispe, gerente general de Kallpa SAB a La República.\n\nAunque no es posible estimar el porcentaje de personas que invirtieron y perdieron o ganaron, sí se puede afirmar que no dependió del monto invertido, sino del momento.\n\n“Hay personas que entraron cuando estaban [las acciones] en el pico y luego cayeron y entonces perdieron, pero también hay muchas personas que ingresaron cuando empezó a caer y luego cuando se fue estabilizando aprovecharon las ganancias”, detalló Diego Torres, CEO y cofundador de la plataforma de trading Trii. “Como cualquier acción, ha tenido fluctuaciones”.\n\nDicho de otro modo, el concepto de ganancias o pérdidas depende de cuándo las personas hayan entrado y cuándo las personas hayan vendido sus acciones, si lo hicieron. Asimismo comparó el caso con la caída en la Bolsa de Wall Street cuando el presidente de Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, comentó que iba a imponer aranceles a todo el mundo.\n\nAumento de personas naturales que son inversionistas en la BVL con datos al 30 de septiembre de 2025. Fuente: CAVALI\n\nSin embargo, Pablo Leno de Renta 4, empresa que ofrece servicios de intermediación financiera y asesoramiento, fue más contundente: “los que perdieron fueron quienes se dejaron llevar por el FOMO (miedo a quedarse fuera) y no se asesoraron por banqueros o traders”.\n\nY es que, como bien explicó, una persona invierte en cualquier momento, sea al principio, al medio, al final, o incluso cuando el mercado está retrocediendo. En ese sentido, para Leno, no es que hubo un momento, sino una falta de concepto.\n\n“No estás invirtiendo en el puerto de Chancay, tú estás invirtiendo en una acción que se llama Inversiones Puerto Chancay (IPCH)”, recalcó.\n\nSignifica que las acciones de Inversiones Puerto Chancay no están obligadas a presentar estados financieros, reportar hechos de importancia ni repartir dividendos. Del otro lado está Cosco Shipping, dueño del 60% del megapuerto de Chancay, pero que no cotiza en Bolsa y no comparte información.\n\nEn consecuencia, con IPCH no existe una valoración sólida de la compañía ni se conoce su verdadero valor fundamental porque no hay información a la cual remitirse. En otras palabras, sin estados financieros ni hechos relevantes, solo es posible hacer una estimación general, pero no un cálculo preciso del valor fundamental de la empresa. Todo esto hace que el análisis sea mucho más complejo.\n\n“Ese tipo de acciones fue aprovechado por los inversionistas más experimentados, aquellos que sabían que se generaría un efecto FOMO. Subieron a la ola, esperaron a que los inversionistas menos experimentados entraran en esa dinámica, y cuando percibieron —porque el mercado lo hace sentir— que ese impulso se estaba agotando, salieron. Finalmente, quienes no tenían mayor experiencia quedaron atrapados”, remarcó con tono crítico.\n\nPUEDES VER: Estos son los millonarios proyectos que impulsarían la conectividad y logística del Megapuerto de Chancay en Perú\n\nAunque se dice que en una inversión en bolsa no hay una ganancia o pérdida generada “hasta que el activo no se venda”, resulta ser un eufemismo porque, en efecto, muchos la llaman una pérdida potencial ya que no se ha “cristalizado”. Sin embargo, si la persona tuviera que vender hoy, estaría asumiendo una pérdida real.\n\nEl escenario plantea la pregunta, entonces, de qué catalizadores de corto plazo existen para que, en este caso, las acciones de Puerto Chancay suban. La respuesta es corta: ninguno.\n\nSegún expertos consultados, solo un evento extraordinario —como que Cosco Shipping decidiera listar sus acciones en la Bolsa de Valores de Lima o anunciara el reparto de dividendos a través de Inversiones Puerto Chancay— podría cambiar el panorama. Empero, hoy por hoy, ninguno de esos catalizadores existe.\n\nLa moraleja no es dejar de invertir en la Bolsa porque es volátil, sino buscar asesoramiento adecuado antes de invertir.\n\nBolsa de Valores de Lima al 4 de noviembre de 2025. Foto: Credicorp Capital/Bloomberg\n\nPor ejemplo, para quienes perdieron en Inversiones Puerto Chancay, los expertos recomiendan asumir la pérdida en lugar de mantener el activo sin perspectivas de recuperación.\n\nEn esos casos, explican que es preferible “tomar la pérdida”, porque mantener una inversión estancada implica también un costo de oportunidad. Lo que implica comprar acciones o, si quieren ser más agresivos, optar por un activo más volátil, como Bitcoin.\n\nDejar el dinero inmovilizado en una acción sin catalizadores que impulsen su valor, advierten, puede ser incluso perjudicial.\n\nPUEDES VER: Megapuerto de Chancay tendrá esta nueva ruta directa con China: productos chinos podrán llegar a Sudamérica en un menor tiempo\n\nEl mercado bursátil peruano cerró con resultados mixtos en lo que va del año, con el liderazgo claro de los sectores financiero y minero. Según datos de Credicorp Capital al 4 de noviembre, las acciones con mejor desempeño fueron:\n\nEso significa que, si una persona hubiera invertido S/100 en Volcan a inicios del año, para el 4 de noviembre de 2025 tendría alrededor de S/250, es decir, 2,5 veces su inversión inicial.\n\nEn el caso de Credicorp, su valor creció un 50% en lo que va del año. Por tanto, quien hubiera invertido S/1.000 al comienzo del 2025, hoy tendría S/1.500.\n\nPor el contrario, algunas empresas registraron caídas:\n\nLa Bolsa Peruana ha subido en un +32% este año, indicado por el indice MSCI NUAM Peru General.\n\nEn el mercado bursátil, las acciones tipo A y tipo B representan diferentes derechos dentro de una misma empresa. En el caso de Inversiones Portuarias Chancay (IPCH), esta clasificación determina tanto el precio como el nivel de participación del inversionista.\n\nPor ese motivo, su precio es más alto. Actualmente, las IPCH tipo A se cotizan en S/1,44 por acción. Sin embargo, tienen menor liquidez, lo que significa que hay menos personas comprando y vendiendo este tipo de acción, por lo que podría tomar más tiempo concretar una transacción.\n\nEn cambio, las acciones tipo B ofrecen únicamente derecho económico, es decir, el inversionista puede recibir dividendos, pero no tiene voz ni voto en las decisiones de la empresa. Su precio es considerablemente menor, situándose alrededor de S/0,12 por acción, y presentan mayor liquidez, lo que facilita su compra y venta diaria.\n\nAhora bien, el movimiento de ambas acciones suele mantener una correlación, por lo que si una sube o baja, la otra tiende a hacerlo en proporciones similares.\n\nPara un inversionista casual o de perfil más pasivo, la diferencia principal entre ambos tipos radica en el precio de entrada y la facilidad para operar en el mercado, más que en el desempeño del activo en sí.', 'https://imgmedia.larepublica.pe/480x264/larepublica/original/2025/11/14/6913b2436a7eb4e41800793d.webp', 'https://larepublica.pe/economia/2025/11/11/inversionistas-peruanos-en-puerto-de-chancay-no-ven-aun-beneficios-hnews-962995', 'original', '2025-11-14 13:36:05', 0, 0, 5, NULL, '2025-11-14 13:36:05', '2025-11-14 13:36:05'),

Y para sus presentaciones en nuestro país, la artista colombiana solicitó la presencia de la Filarmónica de Lima.\n\nComo se sabe, Shakira llega a nuestro país para ofrecer tres conciertos en el Estadio Nacional los días 15,16 y 18 de noviembre. Estas fechas se dieron luego que en febrero de este año, la cantante colombiana sufriera un malestar de salud que la obligó a cancelar su primera fecha en el estadio Nacional.\n\nPor su parte, la Orquesta Filarmónica de Lima anuncia su octavo concierto de la temporada 2025, una cita imperdible para los amantes de la música clásica. El próximo 27 de noviembre a las 8:00 p. m., el Teatro Mario Vargas Llosa será escenario de una noche dedicada a Ludwig van Beethoven, con la interpretación de dos de sus obras más monumentales: el Concierto para piano N.º 2 en Si bemol mayor, Op. 19 y el Concierto para piano N.º 5 en Mi bemol mayor, Op. 73, conocido como “El Emperador”.\n\nEl concierto contará con la presencia del maestro Alexander Paley, quien asumirá el doble rol de solista y director invitado. Reconocido por su técnica deslumbrante y su interpretación apasionada, Paley ha brillado en escenarios legendarios como el Carnegie Hall, el Gewandhaus de Leipzig y el Concertgebouw de Ámsterdam, además de presentarse con orquestas de renombre como la Los Ángeles Philharmonic, la Boston Pops y la Orchestre National de France.\n\nEl Emperador representa la madurez y la afirmación del genio beethoveniano, mientras que el Concierto N.º 2, más juvenil y luminoso, muestra al compositor en formación, todavía bajo la influencia de Mozart y Haydn, pero ya con un espíritu rebelde que anunciaba su revolución musical. Ambas obras, interpretadas por un artista de la talla de Paley, prometen una experiencia única en el escenario limeño.\n\nBajo la dirección artística de Paley la Orquesta Filarmónica de Lima continúa afianzando su compromiso con la excelencia interpretativa y la difusión del gran repertorio sinfónico.

El estreno es el 13 de noviembre.\n\nLa obra maestra de Satoshi Kon, la película anime \'Perfect Blue\', llega a las salas de Perú en una versión remasterizada en 4K, ofreciendo a los espectadores una experiencia visual única.\n\nEste thriller psicológico animado sigue a Mima Kirigoe, una joven idoru (cantante pop idolatrada) que decide dejar su carrera musical para convertirse en actriz. Sin embargo, su transición hacia una vida más adulta se ve amenazada por el acecho de un fan obsesivo y la presión de su propia imagen pública, sumergiéndose en un mundo donde la línea entre realidad y fantasía se desdibuja peligrosamente.\n\nDirigida por Satoshi Kon, artista canónico dentro de la animación japonesa fallecido hace más de una década, PERFECT BLUE marcó su debut como director y sentó las bases de un estilo meta-narrativo único que también exploraría en obras como Millennium Actress y Paprika, donde sueños y realidad se entremezclan, y nada es lo que parece.\n\nAnimación venerada por cineastas de alto calibre como Darren Aronofsky y Christopher Nolan (el primero inspiró múltiples escenas de El Cisne Negro en esta película), \'Perfect Blue\' recibió reconocimientos en festivales como Sitges y Fantasia International Film Festival, consolidando a su director como un visionario del séptimo arte.\n\nDesde su estreno en 1997, \'Perfect Blue\' ha sido aclamada tanto por la crítica especializada como por la audiencia. Su enfoque atrevido sobre la identidad, la fama y la obsesión ha generado opiniones apasionadas: mientras algunos destacan la complejidad de su narrativa y la intensidad de su montaje, otros se sorprenden por la manera en que la película logra mantener al espectador en constante tensión.\n\nEstrenada originalmente en 1995, Macross Plus fue una producción pionera al integrar gráficos 3D por computadora con animación tradicional, abriendo el camino a una nueva era en el anime.\n\nEn plataformas como Rotten Tomatoes la película mantiene una valoración sobresaliente, siendo considerada un imprescindible para cualquier amante del cine de animación y del thriller psicológico. Hoy forma parte del 1 Million Club en Letterboxd.\n\nCon esta remasterización en 4K, \'Perfect Blue\' no solo ofrece imágenes más nítidas y vibrantes, sino que también permite redescubrir cada detalle de una historia que sigue siendo sorprendentemente contemporánea.\n\nSu combinación de suspense, estética noir y profundidad temática hace que tanto quienes ya la conocen como quienes la vean por primera vez puedan disfrutar de una experiencia intensa y única.\n\nUn imprescindible del cine, donde fama, identidad y obsesión se entrelazan en una historia que no se olvida fácilmente. \'Perfect Blue\', desde el 13 de Noviembre en cines locales.\n\nRecibe tu Perú21 por correo electrónico o por Whatsapp. Suscríbete a nuestro periódico digital enriquecido.

La propuesta mezcla acción, crítica social y entretenimiento violento para mostrar un mundo distópico donde el morbo televisivo domina la vida pública.\n\nGlen Powell interpreta a Ben Richards, un hombre trabajador que entra en el mortal concurso como última opción para salvar a su hija enferma. Su interpretación se destaca por combinar vulnerabilidad, coraje e instinto de supervivencia; Powell encarna a Richards como un héroe inesperado que desafía el sistema desde adentro. Josh Brolin, por su parte, da vida a Dan Killian, el despiadado productor del juego, un antagonista magnético cuyo cinismo y ambición reflejan la deshumanización de un mundo obsesionado con el rating.\n\nMás allá de la acción, la película actúa como una crítica mordaz al culto mediático y al consumo de violencia: la sociedad retratada en pantalla adora ver sufrimiento en vivo, y el programa se convierte en un espectáculo masivo que explota el dolor por diversión. La dirección de Wright hace que este trasfondo social sea tan relevante como las escenas de persecución, combinándolo con una estética retro de ciencia ficción —sin caer en la simple parodia— que resuena en el presente.\n\nSin embargo, según algunas críticas, la película —aunque visualmente ambiciosa— falla en su tercer acto: opta por un final alternativo que pierde la ambigüedad emocional del libro original, lo que deja una sensación de oportunidad desaprovechada.

Según la SBS, Financiera Proempresa ofrece la tasa más alta en soles, con una TREA de 6,9% seguida de varias cajas y financieras. La Ley N°32322 permite que los trabajadores retiren el 100% de su CTS hasta el 31 de diciembre de 2026.\n\nEn este contexto, si se busca optimizar el dinero dentro del sistema financiero y sin riesgo, elegir la entidad con mejor rentabilidad resulta fundamental. Al 13 de noviembre de 2025, según datos de la Superintendencia de Banca, Seguros y AFP (SBS) revisados por este diario, existen amplias diferencias en las Tasas de Rendimiento Efectiva Anual (TREA) entre entidades. En general, las financieras y cajas municipales superan ampliamente a los grandes bancos tradicionales.\n\nPUEDES VER: CTS 2025: cómo calcular el monto que recibirás en mayo y noviembre según tu sueldo, tiempo de servicio y régimen laboral\n\nDe acuerdo con el ranking de la SBS, Financiera Proempresa lidera los rendimientos en depósitos CTS en soles, con una TREA de 6,9%. Le siguen Caja Piura, Caja Del Santa y Financiera Oh!, con tasas desde 6,5% anual.\n\nPor ejemplo, si en tu CTS recibirás S/800, con una TREA de 6,9% anual obtendrías aproximadamente S/55 de ganancia al cabo de un año, siempre que el monto permanezca depositado durante todo ese periodo. En cambio, si ese mismo dinero estuviera en un banco que paga 1% anual, el rendimiento apenas llegaría a S/8.\n\nEstas cifras muestran que las entidades de microfinanzas continúan siendo las más competitivas para los ahorros laborales, especialmente para quienes buscan optimizar el rendimiento de su CTS sin asumir mayores riesgos.\n\nA contraparte, los grandes bancos comerciales ofrecen las tasas más bajas del mercado. Interbank en el último lugar (desde 0,25%), Scotiabank (0,30%), BCP (1,0%) y BBVA (1,1%) se ubican al final del listado, con rendimientos muy por debajo del promedio del sistema financiero.\n\nPUEDES VER: OCDE: Perú encabeza en Latinoamérica como el país que más teme a la delincuencia\n\nEs importante recordar que las entidades financieras están reguladas por la SBS y cuentan con la cobertura del Fondo de Seguro de Depósitos (FSD), lo que representa \"un seguro\" para el ahorrista.\n\n\"Para el periodo setiembre–noviembre de 2025, el monto máximo de cobertura asciende a S/118.300. Esto significa que, si una entidad entrara en liquidación o disolución, los ahorros de cada cliente estarían protegidos hasta ese umbral\", explica César Antunez, economista especializado en finanzas.\n\nLa CTS, en su función esencial, es una red de seguridad económica frente a contingencias laborales. Por ello, analizar las tasas, condiciones y solvencia de las entidades antes de depositar los fondos puede marcar una diferencia en el ahorro acumulado a largo plazo.\n\nPUEDES VER: SBS: \"Hasta tres competidores han mostrado su interés de ingresar al mercado de fondo de pensiones\"\n\nLa CTS es un ahorro obligatorio que el empleador deposita para ti dos veces al año (mayo y noviembre). Sirve como \"seguro\" por si pierdes tu trabajo, y su monto depende de tu sueldo y del tipo de empresa donde trabajas. Si trabajas en una empresa grande o mediana, te corresponde una CTS completa, equivalente a un sueldo por cada año trabajado (aproximadamente medio sueldo cada semestre).\n\nLa CTS corresponde a todos los trabajadores formales en planilla del régimen laboral privado, con contrato fijo o indefinido, siempre que trabajen al menos cuatro horas diarias en promedio.\n\nPor el contrario, los trabajadores a tiempo parcial (part time) cuyo horario no alcanza las cuatro horas diarias, no califican para este beneficio.

Ante estas palabras, el \'Tigre\' decidió salir al frente y contar algunos detalles sobre cómo se concretó el fin de su etapa en la selección peruana.\n\nEn una reciente entrevista para el programa \'Fútbol como cancha\', de RPP Noticias, Gareca dejó en claro que él guarda toda la cronología sobre las negociaciones de su renovación.

Yo en eso me desligo de la parte económica. Ni con Oviedo ni con ningún directivo hablé del aspecto económico porque es desgastante.

Esto se originó después que en México aseguraron que Necaxa y Pumas están interesados en contar con el técnico uruguayo para el 2026. Los rumores crecieron aún más este viernes 14 de noviembre luego de que el periodista Horacio Zimmermann deslizó una presunta mala relación entre el \'Nonno\' y Franco Velazco. En medio de estos rumores, el administrador de la \'U\' salió a responder.\n\nDurante la inauguración de las nuevas canchas de vóley en el estadio \'Lolo\' Fernández, Velazco aseguró la permanencia de Jorge Fossati para la próxima temporada. Asimismo, sostuvo que las declaraciones sobre una supuesta discrepancia con el entrenador son completamente falsas.\n\nPUEDES VER: Luis Advíncula lamentó el presente de Junior Ponce, promesa peruana que se probó en FC Barcelona: Mucho talento y cero ganas\n\nTras desmentir la supuesta mala relación con Fossati, Velazco manifestó que estos rumores solo buscan desunir el grupo de Universitario. Asimismo, comentó que están interesados en desestabilizar la \'U\' en lugar de hablar del último tramo del campeonato peruano.\n\n\"Son tonterías. Yo lamento ese tipo de declaraciones. Son trascendidos que no tienen ningún tipo de fundamento. Yo entiendo que la \'U\' les haya malogrado el trabajo a los periodistas por haber terminado el campeonato en octubre, que se tengan que ir de vacaciones temprano. A nadie le interesa el segundo puesto, lo dijo Rodrigo (Ureña), nadie se acuerda del segundo. Entonces, hoy el segundo puesto no le interesa a nadie. En lugar de esta hablando del último tramo del campeonato, sobre los equipos que aún tienen aspiraciones en Sudamericana, Perú 2 o Perú 3 en Libertadores, están más preocupados en inventarse historias con la \'U\'\", dijo para el medio Colectivo World.\n\n\"Nosotros tenemos un principio de unidad, de familia, que ha sido una de las columnas para lograr estos objetivos, tanto para disfrutar los buenos momentos como para superar los malos desde el comienzo de este proceso de recuperación. Así que estos comentarios de malas relaciones son malintencionados, tendenciosos. Buscan generar desunión, desestabilizar esta unidad que tenemos en el plantel: comando técnico, jugadores, directivos, trabajadores y la hinchada\", concluyó.\n\nPUEDES VER: DT de Rusia, Valeri Karpin dio su rotundo análisis sobre el empate de Perú vs Rusia: Fue un buen y digno oponente\n\nLos rumores sobre la salida de Jorge Fossati de Universitario iniciarán en tierras mexicanas. El periodista deportivo Gerardo González informó que Necaxa quiere al uruguayo para que sea el sustituto de Fernando Gago. Sin embargo, no sería el único club, ya que Pumas también lo tiene entre sus opciones.\n\n\"Jorge Fossati aparece como una de las principales opciones para dirigir al Necaxa, en sustitución de Fernando Gago. El tricampeón del futbol peruano también figura en la carpeta de Pumas, en caso de que el proyecto encabezado por Efraín Juárez no prospere en el futuro\", escribió en su cuenta de X.', 'https://imgmedia.larepublica.pe/127x77/larepublica/original/2025/11/14/69177c1e4a6aee36f803a038.webp', 'https://larepublica.pe/futbol-peruano/2025/11/14/administrador-de-universitario-lanzo-tajante-respuesta-sobre-supuesta-mala-relacion-con-jorge-fossati-inventan-historias-de-la-u-305340', 'original', '2025-11-14 22:15:01', 0, 0, 5, NULL, '2025-11-14 22:15:01', '2025-11-14 22:15:01'),

Pero todavía hay margen para eventuales movimientos en la cúpula, como se verá más adelante.\n\nEntre los 11 generales de brigada que pasarán al retiro a fin de año se encuentra el exjefe de la Casa Militar durante la presidencia de Dina Boluarte, José Reátegui Aching, quien tiene una historia.\n\nPUEDES VER: Hubo favoritismo en la compra de 56 blindados para la Policía\n\nCuando el nombre del general Reátegui fue relacionado con las investigaciones sobre el supuesto uso de un vehículo para facilitar la fuga de Vladimir Cerrón Rojas, la exmandataria Boluarte literalmente lo sacó del país. Lo designó delegado del Perú ante la Junta Interamericana de Defensa, en Washington (EEUU). Todos entendieron que era algo parecido a un premio.\n\nOtros generales brigada conocidos son el jefe del Servicio de Material de Guerra del Ejército, Moisés Carbajal Malca, y el jefe del Centro de Mantenimiento Aeronáutico del Ejército (CEMAE), César Claudet Morote.\n\nA partir de un informe de la Contraloría, se menciona al general Carbajal en un presunto caso de favoritismo en beneficio de reparador de helicópteros. El caso está en manos de la fiscalía.\n\nMientras tanto, el general César Claudet reemplazó al general Aldo Domínguez Peral en la jefatura del Centro de Mantenimiento Aeronáutico del Ejército (CEMAE). Domínguez fue destituido luego que si propio instituto militar determinó supuesta responsabilidad en la contratación de la empresa panameña Milenium Veladi Corp., para la rehabilitación de tres helicópteros de fabricación rusa por US$20,300,000.\n\nPUEDES VER: Hace 7 días Contraloría advirtió a ministro del Interior presunta estafa en compra de avión\n\nEl general Domínguez, según las investigaciones fiscales, permitió a Milenium Veladi Corp., que en realidad representa a la firma estatal rusa Compañía Nacional de Servicios Aeronáuticos (NASC), postergara las fechas del cumplimiento del servicio.\n\nCuando lo sustituyó el general César Claudet, este se negó a otorgarle nuevos plazos y se fueron a una conciliación, instancia en la que volvió a rechazar las pretensiones de la compañía rusa que hasta el día de hoy no cumple con el contrato. Según algunas fuentes, Claudet era partidario de rescindir el acuerdo comercial con Milenium Veladi e iniciar acciones legales.\n\nEn relación de pases al retiro también aparecen los siguientes generales de brigadas:\n\nSin embargo, las miradas se dirigen en cómo será el relevo en la Comandancia General del Ejército.\n\nDe asumir el general de división César Briceño Valdivia la jefatura del Comando Conjunto de las FFAA, tendría que reemplazarlo en la Comandancia General del Ejército el número dos de la institución: el jefe del Estado Mayor, general de división Oswaldo Calle Talledo.\n\nPUEDES VER: Gobierno de Jerí pagará US$63,9 millones por avión Antonov “fantasma” para la PNP\n\nFuentes militares indicaron que lo previsto por el Ministerio de Defensa es que se cumpla con el escalafón y la cadena de comando, por lo que el general Oswaldo Calle sería el próximo Comandante General del Ejército.\n\nPero hay un hecho que se debe tomar en cuenta: la reincorporación por vía judicial del general de división Ricardo Bustamante Zúñiga. Bustamante consideró que su pase al retiro decretado por la expresidenta Dina Boluarte en 2023, contravino las normas legales, por lo que inició acciones judiciales. Y ha ganado.\n\nLos simpatizantes del general Bustamante afirman que al reincorporarse al escalafón, podría asumir la Comandancia General del Ejército. Sin embargo, las fuentes consultadas señalaron que el Ministerio de Defensa acatará el fallo judicial, pero que a fin de año Bustamante sería pasado al retiro.\n\nLo cierto es que los generales de división Oswaldo Calle (jefe del Estado Mayor General), Ricardo Bustamante (sin cargo) y Marco Rodríguez Monge (actual Inspector General del Ejército, el número tres del Ejército), son de la misma promoción 1988.\n\nIncluso circula la versión de que el ministro del Interior, general de división EP (r) César Díaz Peche, se inclinaría por el jefe del Comando de Operaciones Terrestres del Ejército (COTE), general de división Julio Castañeda Zegarra, para que ocupe la Comandancia General del Ejército. ¿El motivo? Ambos son del arma de Infantería y Comandos.\n\nFuentes del Ministerio de Defensa como del Ejército manifestaron a este diario que dicha versión carece de sustento, porque se ha resuelto respetar el escalafón y la línea de comando. Inclinarse por Castañeda, implicaría pasar al retiro a los generales de división Oswaldo Calle y Marcos Rodríguez Monge. El gobierno no pretende hacer cambios que generen confrontaciones en pleno proceso electoral.\n\nDe izquierda a derecha.

Ello, según sostiene el Ministerio Públi', 'Óscar Acuña, hermano del líder de Alianza para el Progreso (APP), César Acuña, es investigado por la Fiscalía por el presunto delito de tráfico de influencias. Ello, según sostiene el Ministerio Público, por haber recibido supuestos sobornos del expresidente del directorio de Frigoinca, Nilo Burga.\n\nDe acuerdo con la carpeta fiscal, la ayuda de Acuña Peralta a Burga Malca habría sido con la finalidad de que sea beneficiado en la adquisición de permisos para el funcionamiento de su planta en Chepén y continuar operando en el programa Qali Warma, a cambio de más de S/70.000. Por esta razón, el Ministerio Público allanó su vivienda y las de otros cuatro investigados en La Libertad, Áncash y Lima. Además, se solicitó su detención preliminar por 7 días, pero se encuentra no habido.\n\nPUEDES VER: Rutas de Lima: Corte de New York autoriza al Perú indagar sobre el financiamiento de la concesión\n\nAhora bien, para entender la presunta historia de corrupción habría que colocarse en contexto. De acuerdo con la tesis fiscal, aproximadamente en septiembre del 2022, el supuesto líder de la organización criminal, Nilo Burga Malca, se encontraba preocupado por su licencia de funcionamiento de la planta de producción de Frigoinca en Chepén, La Libertad, debido a que estaba a punto de vencerse.\n\nPero, precisamente, el temor de Burga habría sido por una inspectora de la Gerencia Regional de Salud (Geresa) de nombre \"Roelia\" que iba a cerrar su planta porque en 2020 había tenido una denuncia de la Sociedad Nacional de Industrias ante Indecopi.\n\n\"Es por ello que Nilo Burga Malca busca conexiones, contactos y protección para evitar el cierre de su planta\", afirma la Fiscalía.\n\nEn ese sentido, es que Nilo Burga, aprovechando su cercanía con uno de los investigados, Milton Broca Alcántara, le comenta que tenía problemas con la Geresa de La Libertad y le pregunta si podría ayudarlo. Ante eso, narra el Ministerio Público, Broca le comenta a Burga que \"tenía un contacto\" en Trujillo. Ese personaje en la historia sería, supuestamente, Óscar Acuña Peralta.\n\nAl día siguiente, aproximadamente a las 11 de la mañana, se habrían reunido luego de que Burga buscó en el local del partido de Alianza para el Progreso (APP) a Acuña. Este — Óscar — le mencionó que \"tenía un amigo\" y, en su delante, llamó a Aníbal Morillo Arqueros, quien también es investigado y en su momento fue gerente de Geresa. Ese mismo día, los tres se reunieron en una cevichería y Morillo le dijo a Burga que \"le apoyaría, que no había problema, que le propondrían a una persona imparcial y que, si pasaba la inspección, pasaba\".\n\nLuego de ello, Burga le propuso entregarle S/50.000 a Murillo por su ayuda cada 6 meses \"a fin de que no le cierren su planta\" en Chepén. Ante esto, Murillo le habría indicado que las entregas sean en efectivo y no en su cuenta.\n\nEstos personajes son importantes para la Fiscalía debido a que tanto Morillo Arqueros como Acuña son afiliados a APP. Sin embargo, Morillo fue designado como funcionario de confianza en el cargo de gerente Regional de Salud de la Libertad el 1 de enero del 2023, cuando César Acuña asumía como gobernador regional.\n\nEn ese contexto, la Fiscalía sostiene que Óscar Acuña Peralta, aprovechando el más alto cargo que tenía su hermano César en el Gore La Libertad y su militancia en APP, tenía influencias reales ante Aníbal Morillo Arqueros y, luego de presentarlo con Nilo Burga, obtuvo ventaja o donativo (dinero) de Burga a través de sus empresas vinculadas.\n\nDe acuerdo con la carpeta fiscal, la colaboradora eficaz 5-1-2025 proporcionó información sobre el dinero destinado a Óscar Acuña por S/77.000 en importes que van desde lo S/5.000 hasta los S/30.000. Estos pagos, presume Fiscalía, se habrían hecho pasar o estaría disfrazado como \"préstamos\" porque no se habrían devuelto.\n\n\"La protección y ayuda buscada por Nilo Lino Francisco Burga Malca habría tenido un efecto positivo, pues, pese a que su planta de producción de conservas cárnicas ubicada en el distrito de Paganca, provincia de Chepén, departamento de La Libertad, no cumplía con mantener las condiciones en las cuales fue otorgada su validación HACCP, esta siguió operando con normalidad\", asegura el Ministerio Público.\n\nLa investigación del fiscal provincial Reynaldo Abia Arrieta sostiene que el intermediario entre Aníbal Morillo Arqueros y Nilo Burga Malca fue Óscar Acuña.\n\nDebido a que estos personajes se conocieron, se pudo ayudar a Burga Malca \"en los problemas que tenía la empresa Frigoinca, en los trámites de la validación del Plan HACCP, o revalidación de la licencia de funcionamiento\".\n\nAsimismo, el Ministerio Público señala que los supuestos pagos a Acuña habrían estado vinculados a poner a disposición de su contacto, así como de la intermediación o favor que les realizó a los representantes de Frigoinca.\n\nLas intermediaciones, afirma la Fiscalía, buscó y conllevó decisiones públicas sanitarias ilícitas y al riesgo de la calidad o inocuidad de las conservas cárnicas que iban a ser de alimento a niños y adolescentes en pobreza o pobreza extrema en edad escolar, \"con especial vulnerabilidad, constituyendo los mismos, posteriormente, en sus víctimas\".\n\nPor otro lado, la Fiscalía solicitó el levantamiento de las comunicaciones y telecomunicaciones con la finalidad de efectuar la intervención, monitoreo o grabación de información o data digital de todo lo incautado en el megaoperativo.\n\nDentro del acta fiscal de 136 páginas, se citó el Oficio 5098-2025-DIRNIC-DIRCOCOR-PNP/DIVIDCVCO-DEPEIDCVCOT del 30 de octubre de 2025, en la que se cuenta con la transcripción de la entrevista realizada a Óscar Acuña y Aníbal Morillo.\n\nEn dicho interrogatorio, Acuña confirmó la reunión con Nilo Burga junto con Milton Broca en las instalaciones del local de APP.\n\nEste dato es importante para la Fiscalía porque se acreditaría un supuesto tráfico de influencias y cohecho.', 'https://imgmedia.larepublica.pe/127x77/larepublica/original/2025/11/19/691e1d6317d5aed7c90c81dd.webp', 'https://larepublica.pe/politica/2025/11/19/sobornos-a-favor-de-oscar-acuna-salieron-de-la-empresa-de-nilo-burga-y-fueron-disfrazadas-como-prestamos-hnews-830471', 'original', '2025-11-21 11:01:07', 0, 0, 5, NULL, '2025-11-21 11:01:07', '2025-11-21 11:01:07'),

En declaraciones a RPP Noticias, el presidente del Consejo de Ministros (PCM), Ernesto Álvarez, aclaró que todavía no se ha reunido el Consejo de Ministros para abordar este tema.\n\n\"El gobierno no ha tomado una posición como tal. Esto se tiene que discutir en el Consejo de Ministros, escuchando a los expertos de uno y otro lado (..) Se presume que, en el Pleno, los grupos políticos van a alcanzar los votos para aprobar el dictamen.

Sus votos anteriores sobre la extensión del Reinfo se enmarcaron en el respeto a los acuerdos de su grupo parlamentario.\n\nPUEDES VER: Ampliación del Reinfo hasta 2027: Comisión del Congreso aprueba nueva prórroga a favor de mineros\n\nSi bien Álvarez reconoció que la correlación de votos es favorable para los promotores de una nueva prórroga del Reinfo, fue claro en señalar que no se puede engañar a la población continuamente con \"subterfugios\". En su opinión, el hecho de que este registro haya sido aprovechado por operadores de la minería ilegal, no significa que \"no sirva para nada\".\n\n\"La idea central es que el Pleno del Congreso enfrente la situación actual con la verdad y separe la paja del trigo. No es que el Reinfo no sirva para nada o que todo el mundo ingrese y se aproveche del Reinfo. Hay un grupo malicioso que es minería ilegal y que le conviene ese Reinfo. Pero, también hay otro grupo que sí puede aprovecharlo, en beneficio del país\", sostuvo.\n\nAsimismo, manifestó que el efecto del proceso de formalización minera ha sido minoritario. Hacia el próximo año, cerca de 5.000 mineros informales están en condiciones de incorporarse al registro, mientras que un numeroso grupo (50.265) ha sido rechazado porque vienen actuando de forma maliciosa o nunca tuvieron \"la actitud real\" de legalizarse.\n\nPUEDES VER: Mineros artesanales piden que ampliación del Reinfo hasta diciembre del 2027 sea aprobada en el Pleno\n\nEn su opinión, el Estado debe facilitar la formalización flexibilizando las exigencias para que los mineros artesanales puedan alcanzar los estándares mínimos y realicen labores de explotación en condiciones favorables. No obstante, recordó que el Perú tiene una economía informal y el proceso para adecuarse a la ley es burocrático y oneroso.\n\n\"Para resumir y hacer una síntesis, el Perú es un país eminentemente informal , desde su industria textil, pesca, madera y por supuesto, minería. Dentro de esa informalidad, existe una minera ilegal que maliciosamente se aprovecha de las circunstancias para enriquecerse y alrededor de ello, generar delitos de diversa índole. Pero, también hay pequeña minería que no puede alcanzar estándares de formalización., ya que es difícil, burocrática y onerosa\", argumentó.\n\nPUEDES VER: Ampliación del Reinfo hasta el 31 de diciembre de 2027: ¿qué congresistas votaron a favor?\n\nLa congresista de Avanza País, Diana Gonzáles, fue bastante crítica en sus redes sociales respecto a la indefinición del Poder Ejecutivo en este contexto de movilizaciones de mineros artesanales y una posible prórroga del Reinfo hasta diciembre del 2027. En su opinión, se trata de un silencio cómplice con la decisión adoptada por la Comisión de Energía y Minas.\n\n\"Leí la entrevista del señor primer ministro que se pronuncia en contra de la reincorporación de los 50.00 registros (excluidos del Reinfo), porque de la prórroga no leí nada.

La víctima fue identificada como Pedro Eslava Unocc de 40 años. Cámaras de seguridad grabaron el momento del ataque en el cruce de las avendias Víctor Malásquez con Calle 38 en Manchay, donde es interceptado por un sujeto que le dispara en tres ocasiones antes de escapar.\n\nEl ataque quedó registrado por cámaras de seguridad de la zona, imágenes que son analizadas por la Policía Nacional.

El siniestro dejó a un menor de edad fallecido y al menos ocho personas heridas, varias de ellas de gravedad, según reportes policiales y versiones de testigos.\n\nEl accidente se produjo cuando una combi (placa B2P-719) que realizaba la ruta Pachacútec - Callao, y que circulaba sin pasajeros, habría sufrido una falla en el sistema de frenos. Testigos aseguran que el vehículo perdió el control y colisionó violentamente contra la minivan que se encontraba estacionada con personas en su interior.\n\nPUEDES VER: Asesinan a hombre en la avenida Grau en el Centro de Lima: intentó huir al ser interceptado en su vehículo\n\nHasta el momento, se han identificado a seis de los heridos: Gerardo De la Cruz Huamán (61), Jhon Crisóstomo Prudencio (50), Jorge Ramírez (42), conductor de la miniván; Jorge Ramírez Ramírez (42), Jairzinho Córdova Aquituari (34), Jessica Locono Choca (33), Yeny Teodor (27) y un menor.\n\nEntre los heridos se encuentra un hombre que vendía golosinas cerca del punto del impacto, quien fue embestido por la unidad y quedó gravemente lesionado. Asimismo, una mujer que se encontraba esperando transporte en el paradero fue alcanzada por la combi y también resultó con heridas de consideración.\n\nAlgunos transeúntes pudieron correr y ponerse a salvo instantes antes del choque. Una vecina que presenció el hecho relató que una joven que estaba a su lado fue atropellada por la combi y quedó malherida.\n\nPUEDES VER: Transportistas se pronuncian tras anuncio de paro por nuevos ataques a choferes: “Las rutas están tomadas por la extorsión\"\n\nLos heridos fueron trasladados de emergencia al Hospital de Ventanilla por unidades del SAMU, mientras agentes de la Policía Nacional del Perú (PNP) acordonaron el área para facilitar las labores de rescate y controlar el tránsito. El menor no habría resistido los golpes del impacto.\n\nVecinos exigieron al alcalde de Ventanilla, Jhovinson Vásquez, la instalación urgente de un semáforo y señalización vial en el lugar del accidente, con el fin de prevenir nuevas tragedias. “No es la primera vez que ocurren choques así. No tenemos señalización ni rompemuelles. Ya hemos pedido ayuda, pero nadie hace nada”, declaró una vecina a la prensa.\n\nLa tía del menor que perdió la vida en el trágico accidente denunció que hasta el momento no han recibido información clara sobre el paradero del cuerpo del niño. “No me dan razón. Quien tiene que dar la orden es el fiscal de turno”, declaró a la prensa. Según indicó, el SOAT estaría cubriendo la atención médica de la madre del menor, quien permanece gravemente herida y con pronóstico reservado. “Ella está totalmente devastada”, comentó.\n\nLos familiares solicitaron apoyo económico, ya que no cuentan con los recursos necesarios para brindarle cristiana sepultura al menor. “No tenemos para el sepelio”, lamentó la tía. Además, indicó que testigos del accidente confirmaron a la Policía que el conductor de la combi se habría dado a la fuga tras el impacto, ya que no fue encontrado en el lugar por las autoridades.\n\n¡Sigue a La República en WhatsApp!

En la actualidad, hay más de 57 millones de personas en todo el mundo que viven con demencia\n\nEn la actualidad, hay más de 57 millones de personas en todo el mundo que viven con demencia, siendo la enfermedad de Alzheimer la causa más común. Todos los años se registran 10 millones de casos nuevos de demencia a nivel mundial, lo que cabe preguntarse: ¿qué se puede hacer para ayudar a quienes la padecen?\n\nEste interrogante motivó al actor Chris Hemsworth a llevar a cabo la misión más personal que emprendió hasta el momento el especial: \'Chris Hemsworth: Un viaje para recordar\'.\n\nEn este especial, Chris se embarca en un íntimo viaje en motocicleta por Australia junto a su padre, Craig, que recientemente fue diagnosticado con la enfermedad de Alzheimer, para revivir recuerdos y fortalecer su vínculo, explorando la base científica de la conexión, la comunidad y la nostalgia, herramientas fundamentales y a menudo subestimadas para proteger la salud cerebral.\n\nEl documental de una hora, que es una producción de Protozoa, de Darren Aronofsky, se estrena el 24 de noviembre en Disney+. Chris y su padre visitan a personas y lugares de su historia, desde los suburbios de Melbourne hasta las vastas extensiones silvestres del Territorio del Norte de Australia, para explorar la base científica de la conexión social.\n\nA través de los amplios paisajes australianos, el recorrido de Chris y Craig se convierte en una divertida exploración del vínculo entre padre e hijo, demostrando que el amor y la experiencia compartida pueden ser un poderoso recurso medicinal.\n\nSe habló acerca de la cinta en el más reciente Cinemacon.\n\nSu aventura, parte de la cual está filmada por el propio Chris, está guiada por el Dr. Suraj Samtani, especialista en demencia y psicólogo clínico del Centro para el Envejecimiento Cerebral Saludable de la Universidad de Nueva Gales del Sur, que trabajó con los productores en colaboración con la familia Hemsworth durante el transcurso de un año.\n\nLa investigación del Dr. Samtani, junto con un reciente estudio a nivel internacional que involucró a más de 40.000 personas en 14 países, encontró que quienes mantenían interacciones sociales regulares redujeron a la mitad su riesgo de desarrollar demencia, y hay evidencia de que las conexiones sociales sólidas pueden incluso ralentizar el deterioro cognitivo después del diagnóstico. Este hallazgo fundamental proporciona la base científica para los temas centrales del viaje:\n\n“Mi papá y yo siempre habíamos hablado de hacer un viaje de regreso al Territorio del Norte, donde vivimos con mi familia hace años, pero nunca habíamos tenido el tiempo para hacerlo —dijo Chris en un comunicado de prensa —.

Tras una intensa preparación, las representantes globales se preparan para la recta final del concurso que se llevará a cabo el 21 de noviembre en Tailandia.\n\nEn Perú, debido a la diferencia de horario, probablemente la transmisión en vivo arranque el jueves 20 de noviembre a las 20:00 horas.\n\nLas más de 120 candidatas a la corona de Miss Universo continúan desfilando en traje de gala en la pasarela de Tailanda. Las representantes exponen su belleza y profesionalismo en los escenarios ante los jurados calificadores, conformado por Andrea Meza, Sharon Fonseca, Romero Britto, Ismael Cala, Saina Nehwal, Chalida Thaochalee y Louie Heredia.\n\nComo parte del último desfile del día, Karla Bacigalupo lució en las pasarelas de la preliminar Miss Universo un vestido largo de color celeste con detalles plateados y mangas en sus hombros.\n\nEsta pasarela, en la que la peruana se mostró tranquila y sonriente, es clave para las conclusiones del jurado calificador.\n\nLa Miss Universo 2022, R’Bonney Gabriel, sorprendió al público y jurados en su desenvolvimiento en el escenario como conductora de la gala preliminar.\n\nComo se recuerda, Gabriel es una modelo, diseñadora de moda y reina de belleza estadounidense. Fue la ganadora de la 71. ª edición del certamen internacional siendo coronada el 14 de enero de 2023 como Miss Universo 2022.\n\nDurante la pasarela preliminar que se lleva a cabo este miércoles 19 de noviembre en Tailandia, la Miss Perú, Karla Bacigalupo, se robó las miradas de los asistentes y del jurado calificador.\n\nDe acuerdo con las proyecciones, la representante peruana, al igual que otras candidatas como Miss Colombia, Miss Ecuador, Miss Turks & Caicos, Miss Puerto Rico, Miss Tailandia y Miss Costa de Marfil, se posicionan como las favoritas de la competencia.\n\nEste miércoles en el Impact Arena en Pak Kret de Tailandia se realiza la competencia preliminar del Miss Universo 2025, donde se definirá si la candidata peruana, Karla Bacigalupo, pasa a la final.\n\nEn la jornada se realizó la pasarela de traje típico y traje de baño.\n\nEn su paso con el traje de baño, Karla Bacigalupo se volvió a lucir con un conjunto de dos piezas de color verde.\n\nLa edición número 74 del Miss Universo 2025 está acaparando la atención mundial, aunque no precisamente por las esperadas historias de liderazgo femenino. Las polémicas han puesto al certamen, que se celebrará en Tailandia, en el centro de las conversaciones antes de su gran final.\n\nLa modelo y actriz persigue el sueño de traer a casa la segunda corona universal, un logro que solo ha conseguido Gladys Zender en 1957.\n\nLa gala principal se llevará a cabo en el Impact Challenger Hall en Pak Kret, ubicado en la provincia de Nonthaburi, parte del área metropolitana de Bangkok, Tailandia.\n\nEl inicio de la ceremonia en la sede será a las 8:00 horas (hora local de Bangkok) del 21 de noviembre. Debido a la significativa diferencia horaria con el continente americano, la transmisión llegará a muchos países de América Latina la noche anterior.\n\nEn Perú, debido a la diferencia de horario, probablemente la transmisión en vivo arranque el jueves 20 de noviembre a las 20:00 horas.\n\nPara los espectadores en Latinoamérica, la transmisión en vivo estará disponible a través de cadenas como Telemundo. Además, el evento se podrá seguir en el canal oficial de YouTube de Miss Universo y otras plataformas de streaming asociadas al certamen.\n\nAntes de la noche de la final, las candidatas enfrentarán una serie de competencias y actividades importantes que definirán su pase al cuadro de finalistas:\n\nCon una participación que supera los 130 países, el certamen subraya su alcance verdaderamente global. A pesar de la controversia que opacó la atención inicial, la competencia se mantiene intensa, con Karla Bacigalupo destacando como una de las principales favoritas para llevarse la codiciada corona.\n\nRecibe tu Perú21 por correo electrónico o por WhatsApp. Suscríbete a nuestro periódico digital enriquecido.

El cultivo estaba oculto entre sembríos de maíz en un terreno agreste, al que los agentes debieron llegar luego de una caminata de aproximadamente una hora.\n\nEl operativo se llevó a cabo en el distrito de Independencia, en la provincia de Pisco, en donde la PNP identificó 63 000 plantones en crecimiento y otros 3 000 en proceso de secado, además de 65 kg de marihuana seca, lista para distribución. Las plantas creaban un camuflaje natural gracias al maíz, dificultando su detección tanto desde el suelo como desde el aire.\n\nLa disposición parte de la Ley N.º 32490, la cual establece medidas extraordinarias contra los delitos de extorsión y sicariato.\n\nEl terreno intervenido tiene una extensión de más de tres hectáreas, y según la policía, cada planta tenía un peso promedio cercano a los 300 gramos, lo que permitió estimar que el valor de la droga en el mercado ilegal supera medio millón de soles.\n\nDurante el operativo se detuvo a dos personas, que según las autoridades no contaban con antecedentes penales. Estas personas estarían encargadas del cuidado y riego del cultivo. Tras su arresto, fueron trasladados a la comisaría de Pisco para continuar las diligencias bajo supervisión de la fiscalía.\n\nLa incautación fue seguida por la quema de los plantones, en presencia del Ministerio Público, cumpliendo con los protocolos de destrucción de estupefacientes vigentes.\n\nEste hallazgo se suma a otras recientes acciones policiales en el país. Por ejemplo, en la misma región, la PNP ha realizado decomisos de marihuana en otras operaciones, como el hallazgo de más de tres kilos en un vehículo en Pisco, lo que refuerza la lucha constante contra redes de producción y tráfico de cannabis ilegal.', NULL, 'https://peru21.pe/peru/policia-decomisa-65-mil-plantones-de-marihuana-en-pisco-camuflados-en-sembrios-de-maiz/', 'original', '2025-11-21 11:03:22', 0, 0, 5, NULL, '2025-11-21 11:03:22', '2025-11-21 11:03:22'),

El 71% de estos crímenes fueron cometidos con arma de fuego; en Lima, ese porcentaje asciende al 88%. Incluso podría ser mayor, debido a los registros pendientes de actualización. Ya entre el 10 de octubre y el 14 de noviembre se acumulaban 187 homicidios, “con un promedio diario de 5,19, casi similar a los 5,25 registrados durante el Gobierno de Dina Boluarte”, según los datos sistematizados por el analista Juan Carbajal.\n\nEn los primeros 26 días del estado de emergencia, los distritos más críticos son San Martín de Porres, Ate, Puente Piedra, Villa El Salvador, Los Olivos y Carabayllo, que concentraron 31 homicidios, con 28 de ellos cometidos con arma de fuego. La zona norte de Lima destaca como la más violenta al concentrar la mitad de los asesinatos ocurridos durante la emergencia hasta el 16 de noviembre. Previo a la medida, el número era menor, con solo 18 homicidios desde el 26 de setiembre hasta el 21 de octubre.\n\nPUEDES VER: Transportistas se pronuncian tras anuncio de paro por nuevos ataques a choferes: “Las rutas están tomadas por la extorsión\"\n\nPese a que no se evidencia una reducción en el crimen, el Gobierno anunció que el estado de emergencia será prorrogado nuevamente. La medida, sin embargo, no llega acompañada de metas verificables. “Lo que se necesita es una orientación táctica… ¿se quiere reducir la victimización por extorsión, se quiere reducir los homicidios?”, cuestiona el experto en seguridad Nicolás Zevallos, quien advierte que el Ejecutivo debe definir objetivos cuantificables para evaluar resultados. “El indicador principal… tiene que ver con el homicidio. Deberíamos reducir los homicidios”.\n\nEl exministro del Interior Wilfredo Pedraza coincide en que la estrategia sigue enfocándose en las etapas finales del delito, sin desarticular la estructura detrás. “Con la policía en los vehículos se puede evitar las acciones finales del proceso de extorsión… pero esa es la fase final”, explica. Para él, el eje debe ser la inteligencia: “Si seguimos solo preocupándonos por quienes disparan, el fenómeno extorsivo va a seguir irremediablemente”. Añade que el Gobierno deberá demostrar en esta prórroga “si es más de lo mismo o realmente se ha comenzado a hacer lo único que sirve para combatir la extorsión, que es la inteligencia”.\n\nA ello se suma la mirada del exministro Ricardo Valdés, quien cuestiona si existió o no un análisis profundo de la realidad o un programa operativo claro. “Todo estado de emergencia debe partir de información reconfirmada de la criminalidad que se quiere golpear. Si el objetivo es el sicariato y la extorsión, entonces la policía y el Ministerio Público debieron recopilar toda la información de denuncias, informes y reportes de inteligencia para construir un plan de persecución de líderes criminales”. Un mes después, al no haber resultados, la conclusión es evidente: “Algo ha ocurrido. No han terminado de elaborar el estado de emergencia con base en información detallada y seguimiento de objetivos. No se ha usado la herramienta para desarticular organizaciones”.\n\nSobre las medidas anunciadas (militares en las calles, policías de civil), Valdés es claro: no son nuevas y ya se usaron antes. La diferencia, dice, está en “matices políticos”, una narrativa más activa y visible del Ejecutivo, pero sin cambios estructurales. “Si las cosas siguen mal, ese aire nuevo empieza a ser tóxico. Deja de ser nuevo y se convierte en lo de siempre”.\n\nA nivel político, el analista Luis Benavente señala que el estado de emergencia tiene también un componente simbólico: “Todo gobierno busca ganar adhesión con cada decisión”. Además, enfatiza que la ciudadanía exige impactos rápidos y que un fracaso en seguridad “puede dar pie a una oposición creciente”.\n\nPUEDES VER: Asesinan a hombre en la avenida Grau en el Centro de Lima: intentó huir al ser interceptado en su vehículo\n\nMientras tanto, los números siguen creciendo. Entre el 1 de enero y el 18 de noviembre, SINADEF ha registrado 1.980 homicidios en todo el país, una tendencia que apunta a que el 2025 superará los niveles del 2024. En Lima y Callao, la violencia avanza sin mostrar señales de retroceso, pese al despliegue militar, los operativos en cárceles y los anuncios de nuevas medidas. La ausencia de metas claras, la falta de información pública sobre resultados y la repetición de estrategias ya aplicadas en gestiones anteriores alimentan la percepción de estancamiento.\n\nPara el exministro Valdés, hay soluciones más inmediatas que sí podrían funcionar: digitalizar toda la información existente de denuncias con apoyo de universidades, contratar vigilancia externa especializada en los penales (incluido control de ingreso del personal del INPE) y obligar a que todas las motos nuevas y renovaciones de SOAT incluyan GPS. “Así sí se podría saber qué moto estuvo en un ataque específico a una hora exacta”, explica. Para el exfuncionario Pedraza, la evaluación será inevitable: “La única forma de medir resultados es la reducción de víctimas y el reporte del número de bandas capturadas”. Por ahora, los datos de vidas perdidas indican lo contrario.\n\n¡Sigue a La República en WhatsApp!

De acuerdo con la información policial, el individuo era el principal objetivo en la región, pues era sindicado como cabecilla de la red de sicarios de una facción del Tren de Aragua, denominada Los Espartanos.\n\nAsimismo, esta banda criminal era una de las más buscadas por el Gobierno de Colombia por su relación a una ola de homicidios, extorsiones y amenazas en el municipio extranjero de Yopal, extendiéndose a Maní, Paz de Ariporo, Pore, Trinidad, Aguazul y Villanueva. Cabe precisar que el Gobernador de Casanare, César Ortiz Zorro, ofreció 120 millones de pesos como recompensa para todo aquel que brinde información clave para la captura de \'Mamadeo\'.\n\nPUEDES VER: Tren de Aragua podría reactivarse en Perú tras captura de cabecillas en Colombia, alerta fiscal especializado en crimen organizado\n\nLa detención de alias \'Mamadeo\' en Chimbote fue resultado de una articulación internacional entre la Policía Nacional de Colombia y la Policía nacional del Perú. Además, se contó con el apoyo de la Comunidad Internacional Policial contra el Secuestro y la Extorsión (CIPSE).\n\nA raíz de esta cooperación, se obtuvo información clave para la localización y captura de Oscaiber Torres, quien enfrenta acusaciones de homicidio, tentativa de homicidio y tráfico de armas y municiones. De acuerdo con las investigaciones, \'Mamadeo\' salió de Colombia durante agosto del 2025 y continuó delinquiendo desde el exterior, en Perú. Principalmente, su red operaba en la región extranjera de Casanare, en donde su blanco eran comerciantes y transportadores de Yopal.\n\nPUEDES VER: El Tren de Aragua aparece por primera vez en España con 13 integrantes detenidos en Barcelona\n\nLa información del Depincri Chimbote precisa que el detenido estuvo en territorio peruano hace aproximadamente 40 días con la finalidad de continuar con sus actividades de extorsión.

Cabe precisar que con esta intervención, ya son cinco los presuntos integrantes de la facción del Tren de Aragua tras el último ataque armado contra una barbería en Chimbote.\n\n¡Sigue a La República en WhatsApp!

Entre setiembre y octubre de 2025 cayó de 2,5% a 2,3% del producto bruto interno (PBI), según datos preliminares del Banco Central de Reserva (BCRP). Esta mejora se explica, principalmente, por factores como más ingresos tributarios y un menor pago de intereses de la deuda pública.\n\nLos ingresos del gobierno general crecieron ligeramente hasta 19,3% del PBI, apoyados por una economía más dinámica y mejores precios de exportación. También ayudaron algunos ingresos extraordinarios. Al mismo tiempo, el pago de intereses bajó de 1,7% a 1,6% del PBI debido a la apreciación del sol y a cambios en los plazos de la deuda, lo que alivió el presupuesto.\n\nPUEDES VER: Gobierno evalúa un nuevo bono para comprar una vivienda: jóvenes recién egresados en la mira\n\n\"En la reducción del servicio por intereses influyó el efecto de la apreciación del sol y de los cambios en la estructura de vencimientos, principalmente\", señala el BCRP.\n\nEsto quiere decir que el sol más fuerte abarató la deuda en dólares, porque al Estado le cuesta menos pagarla cuando el tipo de cambio baja.\n\nPUEDES VER: Codip: \"Planeamos construir 1 millón 200.000 viviendas en cinco años; hay mucho apetito del sector C y D\"\n\nCon este avance, el resultado fiscal se acerca al tope fijado para este año (2,2% del PBI). A diferencia de los dos años previos, esta vez el Gobierno estaría en condiciones de cumplir la regla. Más aún con la aprobación de un decreto de urgencia, que establece un conjunto de medidas extraordinarias de austeridad y eficiencia en el gasto público dirigidas a todos los ministerios y organismos del gobierno nacional.\n\nSin embargo, especialistas consultados por este diario advierten que este ajuste \"solo funciona como un parche\" para alcanzar la meta en 2025 y no resuelve los factores estructurales que podrían llevar a nuevos incumplimientos en los próximos años. \"En lo coyuntural puede tener sentido, pero en lo estructural no es una solución\". Ello, debido a que se parte de \"una la lógica cortoplacista como un parche para tratar cuadrar el 2025 y el que venga en 2026 verá cómo hace\", sostuvo el economista Armando Mendoza.\n\nAunque el gasto público total sigue representando el 20,2% del PBI, en términos reales sí aumentó porque el Estado destinó más recursos a algunos rubros. Lo que más creció fueron otros gastos de capital, es decir, gastos relacionados con obras, infraestructura o adquisiciones para mejorar servicios públicos, y en menor medida el gasto corriente, que cubre el funcionamiento diario del Estado.\n\nEn cambio, la inversión pública disminuyó porque varios proyectos de la Autoridad Nacional de Infraestructura y del Plan Nacional de Infraestructura Sostenible avanzaron menos de lo previsto.\n\nEn octubre, el sector público no financiero habría registrado un déficit de S/ 1.700 millones, bastante menor al del mismo mes de 2024 (S/ 3.600 millones). Los ingresos del Gobierno crecieron 12% interanual, impulsados por una recaudación tributaria más fuerte (+13,3%). El gasto también aumentó, aunque a un ritmo más moderado: 3,5%, con un mayor impulso en los gobiernos regionales y municipales.\n\nEn el acumulado de enero a octubre, el déficit llegó a S/13.400 millones, muy por debajo de los S/24.500 millones registrados un año antes. Esto se explica por un crecimiento de los ingresos (12,1%), especialmente de los tributarios (14,1%). El gasto público subió 4,8%.\n\nPUEDES VER: Conciertos: Comisión del Congreso aprueba dictamen que permite a asistentes ingresar con agua y alimentos\n\nPor el lado de los ingresos, el impulso llegó por mayores pagos del impuesto a la renta (IR), impuesto general a las ventas (IGV interno), impuesto selectivo al consumo (ISC), regularizaciones tributarias, traslado de detracciones y aportes por contribuciones sociales.\n\nTambién ayudaron las utilidades transferidas por las empresas públicas agrupadas en el Fondo Nacional de Financiamiento de la Actividad Empresarial del Estado (Fonafe), el principal conglomerado empresarial estatal peruano que administra 35 empresas públicas.\n\nEn el gasto, los mayores desembolsos se concentraron en \"otros gastos de capital\", debido a que el Estado asumió garantías relacionadas a créditos del Banco de la Nación para Petroperú.\n\n\"Si bien las operaciones de apoyo (capitalización en 2024 y honra de garantías en 2025) no implican directamente un incremento en el déficit en ese momento, se producen dada la fragilidad financiera de la empresa, que a la fecha continúa mostrando un resultado económico negativo neto del apoyo, aunque menor al del año anterior\", sostiene el BCRP.\n\nSolo en octubre de 2025, el Estado pagó S/379 millones por estas garantías, y entre junio y octubre los pagos sumaron S/2.400 millones.', 'https://imgmedia.larepublica.pe/480x264/larepublica/original/2025/11/21/691def96aa5726788d03abe6.webp', 'https://larepublica.pe/economia/2025/11/19/deficit-fiscal-se-reduce-a-23-del-pbi-y-roza-la-meta-un-sol-apreciado-redujo-el-costo-de-la-deuda-hnews-1301690', 'original', '2025-11-21 15:23:03', 0, 0, 5, NULL, '2025-11-21 15:23:03', '2025-11-21 15:23:03'),

De esta manera, con 16 votos a favor se aprobó inhabilitar por 10 años de la función pública a la suspendida fiscal de la Nación, Delia Espinoza; mientras que no alcanzaron los votos para inhabilitar a Juan Villena, Pablo Sánchez y Zoraida Ávalos.\n\nPUEDES VER: Gobierno de José Jerí insiste en proyecto de ley que crea el delito de información reservada\n\nCon 17 votos a favor, 5 en contra y 1 abstención, la Comisión Permanente del Congreso aprobó levantar el fuero a Delia Espinoza para que pueda ser procesada por la Fiscalía por los presuntos delitos de falsedad genérica, prevaricato y usurpación de funciones. Todo esto, deberá ser ratificado en el Pleno del Congreso que no contará con los votos de los miembros de la Comisión Permanente.\n\nVotaron a favor: Ilich López y Carlos Alva (Acción Popular); Alejandro Cavero (Avanza País); Flavio Cruz y María Taipe Coronado (Perú Libre), Lady Camones, Jorge Marticorena y Eduardo Salhuana (APP); Patricia Juárez, Martha Moyano, César Revilla y Arturo Alegría (Fuerza Popular); Alejandro Muñante y Jorge Zeballos (Renovación Popular); Ana Zegarra Saboya (Somos Perú), Dinga Calle (Podemos Perú)\n\nEn contra: Víctor Cutipa y Wilson Quispe (JPP), Gladys Echaíz (Honor y Democracia), Edgar Reymundo (Bloque Democrático)\n\nAbstención: Alfredo Pariona (Bancada Socialista), Ariana Orué (Podemos Perú)\n\nLa Comisión Permanente del Congreso aprobó el informe que recomienda inhabilitar por 10 años a la fiscal de la Nación suspendida, Delia Espinoza. El grupo de trabajo alcanzó 16 votos a favor, 4 en contra y 2 abstenciones.\n\nLa Comisión Permanente del Congreso no aprobó el informe que propone inhabilitar por 10 años a la fiscal suprema Zoraida Ávalos. El grupo de trabajo contó con 6 votos a favor, 2 en contra y 11 abstenciones.\n\nLa Comisión Permanente del Congreso alcanzó los votos necesarios para aprobar el informe que planteaba la inhabilitación por 10 años de la función pública contra el fiscal supremo Pablo Sánchez. El grupo de trabajo solo contó con 6 votos a favor, 2 en contra y 11 abstenciones. Al igual que con la denuncia constitucional contra Juan Carlos Villena, la Comisión tendrá que volver a votar en otro momento y tomar una decisión sobre el futuro de Sánchez.\n\nLa Comisión Permanente del Congreso no aprobó el informe de inhabilitación contra el fiscal supremo Juan Carlos Villena. Hubo 6 votos a favor, 5 en contra y 8 abstenciones. \"El Congreso no ha tomado una decisión y votará en otra oportunidad\", dijo el vicepresidente del Parlamento, Waldemar Cerrón. El fujimorismo no votó debido a que sus integrantes no respondieron al momento de la votación, mientras que APP votó en abstención.\n\nEl congresista Edgardo Reymundo aseguró que su bancada del Bloque Democrático votará en contra del informe que propone inhabilitar a los fiscales supremos. \"Si alguien está en desacuerdo con el reglamento emitido por la Junta de Fiscales, debe recurrir ante el Poder Judicial para no intentar descabezar al Ministerio Público, tenemos que defender el fuero respetando la legalidad. ¿Qué queremos, precipitarnos más en la democracia? Eso no es posible\", sostuvo.\n\nAhora, el congresista de Avanza País, Alejandro Cavero, inicia el debate y descarta que la ley 32130 aprobada por el Parlamento no es inconstitucional y que continúa vigente. Además, se muestra contrario a la intervención del fiscal supremo Juan Carlos Villena y los argumentos de su abogado. \"La autonomía es respetar la ley y eso no han hecho los fiscales\", dijo.\n\nLa fiscal suprema, Zoraida Ávalos, intervino en la sesión de la Comisión Permanente y negó los hechos que se le imputan para que sea inhabilitada. Ávalos afirmó que el reglamento cuestionado por el Congreso fue aprobado por su colega Juan Carlos Villena y que la aprobación de directivas y reglamentos no es competencia de la Junta de Fiscales Supremos. Asimismo, señaló que no se presentaron documentos que sustenten una infracción constitucional.\n\nEl fiscal supremo se pronuncia durante la Comisión Permanente como parte de su derecho a la defensa. Por su parte, su abogado solicitó que se archive la denuncia constitucional contra su patrocinado.\n\nSamuel Abad, abogado de los fiscales supremos, le responde al Congreso y asegura que la investigación del delito le corresponde a la Fiscalía, tal como lo ordena la Constitución Política del Perú. Esto lo mencionó como parte de la defensa ante las inhabilitaciones. Se le acusa a los miembros del Ministerio Público de haber transgredido la ley 32130 que aprobó el Parlamento para que se le asigne a la PNP las indagaciones del delito.\n\n\"No hay ninguna infracción a la Constitución. Que no le parezca una interpretación adecuada a la SAC, es una opción, pero otra cosa es que, por no compartir esa intepretación, pretendan inhabilitar a cuatros fiscales supremos y denunciar a quienes persiguen delitos\", dijo.\n\nSamuel Abad, abogado de Juan Carlos Villena, toma la palabra en la Comisión Permanente. También asumirá la defensa legal de Delia Espinoza, Pablo Sánchez y Zoraida Ávalos.\n\nCambios. El primer vicepresidente y encargado del Congreso, Fernando Rospigliosi (Fuerza Popular), se retiró del Hemiciclo y le otorgó la conducción del debate y votación de los informes de inhabilitación contra los fiscales supremos y Pedro Castillo, a Waldemar Cerrón (Perú Libre).\n\nLady Camones (Alianza para el Progreso) sustenta el informe de inhabilitación contra los fiscales supremos. Camones tendrá un tiempo de 20 minutos para sustentar el pedido de la Subcomisión de Acusaciones Constitucionales contra los magistrados.\n\nEl presidente del Congreso, Fernando Rospigliosi, informó que los fiscales supremos, Delia Espinoza, Pablo Sánchez, Juan Carlos Villena y Zoraida Ávalos acudieron al Congreso junto con sus abogados para ejercer su derecho a la defensa contra los informes de inhabilitación por 10 años.\n\nEl presidente del Congreso, Fernando Rospigliosi, dio el inicio a la sesión de la Comisión Permanente. Hay un quorum de 15 congresistas de 27.\n\n\"“Vamos a debatir y vamos a escuchar a los congresistas delegados y vamos a tomar una decisión posterior a ello”, dijo sobre la denuncia constitucional contra los fiscales supremos. Por otro lado, se refirió al informe de inhabilitación contra Pedro Castillo: \"“En el caso de Betssy Chávez y Pedro Castillo tenemos una posición firme de que ellos han participado de manera directa y debe corresponder una sanción que es la inhabilitación y el levantamiento del fuero”.\n\nSi la Comisión Permanente aprueba el informe de la Subcomisión de Acusaciones Constitucionales (SAC), el caso pasaría al Pleno del Hemiciclo en la que votarían todos los congresistas menos los miembros de la Permanente. Si en esa instancia se da el visto bueno, se consumaría las inhabilitaciones contra Pedro Castillo, Delia Espinoza y fiscales supremos.\n\nDe acuerdo con la agenda del Congreso, la sesión de la Comisión Permanente comenzaría a partir de las 9 de la mañana y se realizará desde el recinto del Parlamento. Se espera que el abogado de los fiscales supremos acuda a la audiencia para ejercer el derecho a la defensa de los investigados.\n\nLa Comisión Permanente del Congreso contaría con los votos necesarios para aprobar la propuesta de la Subcomisión de Acusaciones Constitucionales (SAC) contra estos miembros del Ministerio Público. Según un conteo realizado por este diario, 12 parlamentarios de la Comisión Permanente —son 27 en total— votarían a favor de inhabilitar a la fiscal suspendida Delia Espinoza y a sus colegas Juan Carlos Villena, Pablo Sánchez y Zoraida Ávalos.\n\nLa Comisión Permanente del Congreso evaluará este martes 25 de noviembre los informes finales de la Subcomisión de Acusaciones Constitucionales (SAC) que recomiendan inhabilitar por 10 años al expresidente Pedro Castillo por su intento de golpe de Estado en diciembre de 2022.\n\nAdemás, se analizarán otros informes contra los fiscales supremos Delia Espinoza, Juan Villena, Pablo Sánchez y Zoraida Ávalos por presuntas infracciones constitucionales al emitir una resolución en octubre de 2024 que vulneraría la Ley 32130, la cual otorga a la Policía Nacional del Perú la investigación del delito.\n\nEstos fueron Arturo Alegría y Martha Moyano, de Fuerza Popular; Ana Zegarra Saboya, de Somos Perú; Elizabeth Taipe Coronado, de Perú Libre; Digna Calle, de Podemos Perú; y Lady Camones, de Alianza para el Progreso (APP). Por su parte, Elvis Vergara Mendoza (Acción Popular), votó en abstención.\n\nAsimismo, se prevé el voto a favor del fujimorista Fernando Rospigliosi, primer vicepresidente del Congreso y presidente de la Comisión Permanente. Ello debido a que, junto con José Cueto (Honor y Democracia) y Alfredo Azurín (Somos Perú), presentaron la denuncia constitucional 528 contra los fiscales supremos. Además, si la bancada fujimorista vota en bloque, se asegurarían 2 votos más a favor de la inhabilitación. Fuerza Popular cuenta con 5 integrantes en esta comisión.\n\nOtros dos congresistas que votarían a favor de este informe, serían Zeballos Aponte Jorge Arturo y Muñante Barrios Alejandro (Renovación Popular), debido a que en junio de este año presentaron como bancada una denuncia constitucional contra Espinoza, Ávalos y Villena en medio del regreso de Patricia Benavides a la Fiscalía.\n\nDías después, en julio, la SAC admitió a trámite dicha denuncia y contó con el voto de Flavio Cruz (Perú Libre), quien también podría votar a favor de las inhabilitaciones.\n\nDe esta manera, irían 12 votos a favor y una abstención. Es decir, casi la mitad del total de integrantes de la Comisión Permanente (27) votaría a favor de la inhabilitación de los fiscales supremos.\n\nPor su parte, el congresista Alfredo Pariona (Bancada Socialista) aseguró a este diario que tomarían una decisión junto con su bancada y, a partir de ello, votarían.\n\nPUEDES VER: Claudia Sheinbaum responde a José Jerí por Betssy Chávez: \"Una intervención en la embajada estaría fuera de toda norma\"\n\nEl 19 de noviembre, los fiscales supremos fueron citados para asistir hoy a la Comisión Permanente para ejercer su derecho a la defensa. En caso no puedan asistir, podrá hacerlo su abogado. La sesión está programada para las 9 de la mañana.\n\nLa propuesta presentada por los congresistas Rospigliosi, Cueto y Uzurín acusa a los magistrados de haber cometido diversas infracciones constitucionales y presuntos delitos penales, como abuso de autoridad, falsedad genérica, prevaricato y usurpación de función pública. Estas acusaciones están relacionadas con la emisión de la resolución 2246-2024 el 14 de octubre de 2024, la cual aprobó un nuevo reglamento que, según se alega, violaría la Ley N.º 32130, una norma destinada a fortalecer el papel de la Policía Nacional del Perú (PNP) en la investigación del delito.\n\nLa denuncia constitucional argumenta que, al ordenar la continuación de la investigación material en el ámbito fiscal, los acusados invadieron las competencias de la PNP y fomentaron el incumplimiento de una ley vigente. En este contexto, se les imputa a los fiscales la presunta violación de cinco artículos de la Constitución Política del Perú.\n\nAdemás de la propuesta de inhabilitación, se sugiere levantar el fuero de los cuatro fiscales supremos para que el Fiscal de la Nación pueda presentar una denuncia penal ante la Corte Suprema. Los presuntos delitos funcionales imputados son abuso de autoridad, prevaricato, usurpación de función pública y falsedad genérica.\n\nEn caso el informe sea aprobado en la Comisión Permanente, esta pasará al Pleno para ser sometido a debate y votación.

Frente al avance de la criminalidad, afirma que la UE negocia un acuerdo entre Europol y la Policía Nacional para fortalecer los operativos, pero basados en inteligencia.\n\n— Perú ha exportado más de US$58.000 millones a la Unión Europea desde 2013, con un crecimiento fuerte en el sector agro. Han pasado más de 10 años de acuerdo comercial, ¿cuál es la evaluación que hace?\n\nEstamos muy contentos con la implementación del acuerdo. Consideramos que ha sido mutuamente beneficioso. El crecimiento del Perú desde 2013 se debe a los esfuerzos de los propios peruanos, empresarios y agricultores, pero también pensamos que la apertura del mercado europeo, que es muy importante y exigente, ha contribuido al crecimiento y a la competitividad de la economía peruana, en particular del sector agroexportador.\n\nPUEDES VER: Ley de Presupuesto 2026 no incluye las 38.000 becas anunciadas por el Gobierno: 20.000 de Beca 18 quedan sin financiamiento\n\n— Más allá de la agroindustria, ¿qué otros sectores de alto valor ve el mercado europeo con mayor potencial?\n\nEl crecimiento más importante desde el inicio del acuerdo ha sido el agroexportador, que incluso ya supera al sector minero en envíos a la Unión Europea. Ambos dominan, y aún hay muchísimo potencial en agro. También vemos potencial en manufactura, artesanía, moda, joyería y turismo.

Y otro es el Terminal Norte Multipropósito del Puerto del Callao, de APM Terminals que tiene una inversión de enorme envergadura. Ambos (proyectos) muestran que el Perú continúa siendo atractivo para la inversión europea.\n\n— Se generó una controversia por el cobro de la Tarifa Unificada de Transferencia (TUUA) del aeropuerto Jorge Chávez, ¿cuál es la posición de la UE?\n\nNo comentaré detalles ni posturas que han tomado las partes. Solo mencionaría que la estabilidad jurídica es importante para que el país siga atrayendo inversiones que potenciam al país. Los convenios asumidos deben cumplirse para mantener atractivo al país y no poner en duda la confianza de los inversionistas.\n\n— El avance de la criminalidad preocupa. ¿Qué apoyo concreto brinda la UE al Perú?\n\nComo en muchos países del mundo, la seguridad ciudadana está llamando mucho la atención. Desde la UE estamos apoyando a toda la cadena penal para compartir buenas prácticas entre pares y el fortalecimiento institucional, así como la articulación entre Policía, Fiscalía, Poder Judicial y ministerios. Un modelo que promovemos es el de equipos multidisciplinarios especializados para llevar a cabo investigaciones, donde Policía y Fiscalía trabajan de la mano. Ya se aplica en crímenes medioambientales y homicidios de líderes indígenas con resultados iniciales positivos.\n\nEstamos hablando con el gobierno sobre la posibilidad de tener un acuerdo entre Europol, que es la agencia que coordina las investigaciones policiales en la Unión Europea, y la Policía Nacional de Perú para intercambiar datos personales y no personales. Consideramos que si se lograra firmar ese acuerdo sería un apoyo importante para que en Perú se pueden llevar a cabo operativos de la Policía basados en inteligencia.\n\n— ¿Ha sido buena la recepción de este gobierno interino?\n\nSí, no puedo hablar en nombre del gobierno peruano porque siempre hay una negociación en ambas partes, pero estamos en discusiones activas. Desde la Unión Europea lo consideramos un apoyo concreto que podría ayudar al gobierno a conseguir sus metas.\n\nGobierno de José Jerí oficializó extensión del estado de emergencia en Lima y Callao por 30 días. Desde la Unión Europea, buscan acuerdo para operativos basados en inteligencia.\n\n— ¿Han recibido reportes de empresas europeas que retrasen inversiones por la inseguridad?\n\nNo tengo a la mano información específica sobre ese punto.\n\n— Este es el octavo año apoyando al Perú en economía circular. ¿Qué avances concretos se han dado?\n\nDesde 2018 avanzamos juntos hacia la circularidad porque estamos convencidos de que es el futuro. No se puede seguir con el modelo lineal de economía, de extraer, transformar y desechar residuos. Considerando el impacto en el planeta, nuestros esfuerzos no pueden ser suficientes sin trabajar de la mano con socios internacionales como el Perú. Hemos visto mucho interés y compromiso. Los avances a nivel de políticas públicas son la adopción de una Hoja de Ruta Nacional con metas al 2030. Para dar efecto, hay que enfocarla en Hojas de ruta sectoriales en manufactura, infraestructura y comercio interno, agricultura, pesquería, agua y saneamiento, y ahora turismo.\n\nNo se pueden lograr avances en economía circular si no hacemos esfuerzo conjunto de toda la sociedad. No puede funcionar sin el sector empresarial y sin la demanda de la ciudadanía por esos servicios y productos. También trabajamos en siete provincias para impulsar alianzas regionales.\n\n— La UE evalúa un periodo de gracia para implementar la reglamentación de antideforestación, ¿Cómo lo deben interpretar los productores peruanos?\n\nHace unos años, adoptamos el reglamento sobre cadenas de valor libres de deforestación, porque somos conscientes de que la lucha contra la deforestación es un compromiso internacional en el marco del cambio climático. Aunque en Europa no tenemos muchos bosques, sí somos grandes consumidores de productos cuyas cadenas de valor pueden incidir en la deforestación; por eso asumimos la responsabilidad de garantizar que lo que consumimos sea libre de deforestación.\n\nEn el Perú hemos visto mucho compromiso por parte del Midagri y de Devida, porque en muchas de las zonas involucradas se promueven cultivos alternativos como el café. Los productores también han avanzado en georreferenciación y en otros requisitos necesarios para cumplir con la norma.\n\nLa Unión Europea, siendo un mercado grande, próspero y exigente, demanda productos de alta calidad, y el café y el cacao peruanos son muy apreciados. Por eso, desde ambos lados, estamos trabajando para que se cumplan correctamente los requisitos del reglamento y para que el Perú pueda seguir exportando esos productos tan valorados.\n\n— ¿Cómo han ajustado su estrategia comercial y de inversión frente a los aranceles de Estados Unidos?\n\nNo quiero comentar sobre lo que hacen los demás. Lo que puedo asegurar es que la UE sigue comprometida con sus obligaciones de libre comercio y en ser un socio confiable y predecible. Tenemos un tratado de libre comercio con el Perú y casi todas las importaciones peruanas están exoneradas de aranceles. Nosotros seguimos cumpliendo con eso. Estamos convencidos de que ese marco sigue siendo realmente beneficioso y es el camino que hay que seguir.', 'https://imgmedia.larepublica.pe/480x264/larepublica/original/2025/11/24/6922f3ecaa5726788d03acb4.webp', 'https://larepublica.pe/economia/2025/11/23/embajador-de-la-union-europea-la-estabilidad-juridica-en-peru-ya-no-se-puede-dar-por-sentada-hnews-1145216', 'original', '2025-11-25 17:15:40', 0, 0, 5, NULL, '2025-11-25 17:15:40', '2025-11-25 17:15:40'),

Esta omisión fue alertada por la Red Nacional de Juventudes (Renajuv) y este diario pudo comprobarlo con documentos y fuentes sectoriales.\n\nPUEDES VER: Embajador de la Unión Europea: \"El marco jurídico en Perú no se puede dar por sentado\"\n\nDe acuerdo con documentación a la que accedió este medio, el Programa Nacional de Becas y Crédito Educativo (Pronabec), entidad a cargo de estas becas, envió en junio al Minedu, y este, a su vez, al Ministerio de Economía y Finanzas (MEF) la demanda adicional de S/793 millones para cubrir el déficit en cuanto a las becas previstas.\n\nSin embargo, el MEF no incorporó este requerimiento en el proyecto de ley de presupuesto, enviado al Congreso el 30 de agosto. En su respuesta oficial a la Renajuv, según se lee, la cartera de Economía señaló que no es su competencia agregar artículos una vez remitido el proyecto y deslizó que la responsabilidad recaería en el Minedu. No obstante, documentos internos del sector Educación confirman que el pedido sí fue registrado y tramitado dentro del flujo presupuestario, pero, en el ir y venir del tramo del proceso el financiamiento fue retirado.\n\nPUEDES VER: La paradoja de Lima: la región ‘más rica’ del Perú se hunde en bienestar\n\nAunque las becas están previstas a otorgarse en 2026, la gravedad directa recae primero sobre los postulantes de Beca 18, cuyo proceso está en curso y el pasado 16 de noviembre rindieron el Examen Nacional, como primer paso para acceder a una de las 20.000 becas prometidas por el Gobierno. Son casi 100.000 jóvenes, la mayoría en pobreza o pobreza extrema, quienes ahora permanecen en incertidumbre. Las otras becas comprometidas originalmente por el Poder Ejecutivo son de 10.000 plazas para Beca Tec y 8.000 para Beca Permanencia. Sin financiamiento, ninguna de estas convocatorias puede avanzar a fase de selección ni firma de compromisos, según confirmaron fuentes del Pronabec.\n\nOjo aquí. Pese a la omisión en el proyecto de ley de Presupuesto Público 2026 (PL 12255) presentado en agosto de 2025, el premier Ernesto Álvarez, durante su presentación de investidura para recibir el voto de confianza el 22 de octubre, afirmó ante el Congreso que el Gobierno sí otorgaría las 38.000 becas como parte de su política de igualdad de oportunidades.\n\n“Apostamos por el acceso real a la educación superior, otorgaremos 20.000 becas 18, 10.000 becas TEC y 8.000 Becas Permanencia. Uno de los principios constitucionales más significativos es la igualdad de oportunidades que otorga la posibilidad de estudiar en condiciones de calidad a los hijos de familias sin recursos que por carecer de dinero no pueden desarrollar sus capacidades y su decidida vocación de estudio. Ningún joven debe carecer de oportunidad. Para eso existe el Estado\", aseguró.\n\nEl anuncio —aplaudido en su momento— no corresponde con el contenido del dictamen final aprobado el 19 de noviembre. Es decir, un discurso político vacío ante el expediente presupuestal que será votado, como máximo, esta semana.\n\nFuentes consultadas por este medio señalaron que la única vía disponible para evitar que las convocatorias se queden sin recursos es que el Pleno del Congreso incorpore una disposición complementaria que incluya el presupuesto omitido.\n\nUna propuesta en ese sentido ya fue presentada por la congresista Lady Camones, quien solicitó agregar S/529 millones para Beca 18 y S/114 millones para Beca Tec, además de los recursos faltantes para continuadores.\n\nDesde Renajuv, su presidente Anthony James Ramos confirmó a La República que han remitido oficios al Congreso y a la Presidencia del Consejo de Ministros alertando de la situación, y advirtió que, si el presupuesto no se incorpora esta semana, miles de jóvenes quedarán suspendidos en mitad del proceso.\n\nHasta el cierre de esta edición, el Ministerio de Economía y Finanzas no ha dado ninguna explicación a este diario sobre por qué la partida de becas no fue incluida ni si propondrán una reestructuración antes del debate en el Pleno esta semana.\n\nFuentes vinculadas al proceso señalaron que, tras detectarse que el presupuesto de Pronabec no había sido incorporado en el Proyecto de Ley enviado por el MEF, se produjo una fuerte presión interna dentro del sector Educación. Desde dicha cartera le habrían pedido la renuncia a la directora de Pronabec, Alexandra, Ames, luego de que la ministra de Economía Denisse Miralles informara al presidente José Jerí que el programa habría convocado becas sin contar con recursos asegurados, pese a que la documentación enviada al MEF lo niega. En una actualización, a la fecha, el Minedu decidió aceptar su renuncia la noche del domingo.\n\nUna fuente con acceso directo al proceso explicó a este medio que la directora de Pronabec consultó al MEF tras detectar la omisión, obteniendo como respuesta que habría existido una “confusión”, aunque sin mayor detalle. Esta versión no coincide con la respuesta formal que el MEF envió luego por transparencia.\n\nMediante un comunicado enviado esta noche, el Ministerio de Educación afirmó que \"el requerimiento presupuestal para las becas 2026 fue presentado dentro del proceso regular\" y que la preselección de Beca 18 \"se ha realizado conforme al marco legal y técnico vigente\". Sin embargo, reconoce que todo depende de la aprobación del Presupuesto 2026 y de \"los recursos que se asignen\", lo que confirma que no existe financiamiento garantizado.', 'https://imgmedia.larepublica.pe/127x77/larepublica/original/2025/11/23/6923a29e17d5aed7c90c82b2.webp', 'https://larepublica.pe/economia/2025/11/23/ley-de-presupuesto-2026-no-incluye-las-38000-becas-anunciadas-por-el-gobierno-20000-de-beca-18-quedan-sin-financiamiento-hnews-2266811', 'original', '2025-11-25 17:15:42', 0, 0, 5, NULL, '2025-11-25 17:15:42', '2025-11-25 17:15:42'),

Esto provoca el aumento de residuos de aparatos eléctricos y electrónicos (RAEE), los desechos de más rápido crecimiento en el mundo.\n\nSegún la ONG Ciudad Saludable, los residuos –incluidos los electrónicos– pueden incrementarse hasta en 15% durante diciembre, mientras que los comercios concentran el 26% y el sector servicios el 14% de los desechos generados.\n\nSe usarán nuevas funciones como códigos pins obligatorios.\n\nLa combinación de cierres de año, inventarios, renovación tecnológica por campañas comerciales y regalos corporativos convierte esta época en un momento crítico para evaluar cómo se gestionan los RAEE.\n\n“Los residuos electrónicos no solo representan un reto ambiental. También son una oportunidad para generar valor social si se gestionan formalmente. Su adecuada valorización permite recuperar materiales, reducir riesgos operativos y contribuir al desarrollo de comunidades vulnerables”, explica Edgar Aguilar, gerente general de Comimtel.\n\nEn este contexto, la correcta disposición de RAEE se volvió un indicador de desempeño y compromiso con la sostenibilidad, por lo cual se promueven iniciativas para demostrar que su gestión responsable puede generar impactos mucho más allá del reciclaje.\n\n1. Contribución económica. La gestión formal permite recuperar materiales valorizables, reducir costos de almacenamiento, evitar sanciones y asegurar el cumplimiento normativo.\n\n2. Contribución ambiental. La disposición adecuada evita la liberación de sustancias peligrosas, previene contaminación y favorece la economía circular en un periodo de alto consumo.\n\n3. Contribución operativa. Mantener puntos de acopio internos y clasificar equipos obsoletos mejora el orden, agiliza inventarios y facilita la programación de recojo con operadores autorizados.\n\n4. Contribución a la seguridad empresarial. La eliminación informal de equipos puede exponer datos sensibles. La destrucción certificada protege la información y garantiza cumplimiento regulatorio.\n\nCon estas prácticas, la gestión formal de RAEE se posiciona como una herramienta clave para generar valor económico, ambiental y social en una de las temporadas de mayor actividad del año.\n\nRecibe tu Perú21 por correo electrónico o por WhatsApp. Suscríbete a nuestro periódico digital enriquecido.

Para lograrlo, Papa Noel lo guiará por tres ambientes conceptuales: un mundo de metal, uno de plástico y otro virtual, representando escenarios para su evolución personal. La obra quiere tratar temas sobre el materialismo y las dinámicas sociales contemporáneas.\n\nDurante su aventura, Martin se volverá más valiente, y aprenderá que aspectos como la fuerza, la belleza y la popularidad digital no tienen el mismo valor a comparar con el amor, la amistad y la familia.\n\nEl elenco está compuesto por actores conocidos como Fiorella Florez como la madre, y el niño es actuado por Izan Alcázar, quien antes estuvo en la película \'Chabuca\'.
